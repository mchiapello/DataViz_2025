happy perfect welcome everyone I am so happy perfect welcome everyone I am so happy you want to join me for this today this you want to join me for this today this you want to join me for this today this is this is a webinar it's a version of a is this is a webinar it's a version of a is this is a webinar it's a version of a workshop I gave recently at the workshop I gave recently at the workshop I gave recently at the celebration our conference and this is celebration our conference and this is celebration our conference and this is the very first time I'm doing any the very first time I'm doing any the very first time I'm doing any screencast so you are actually just screencast so you are actually just screencast so you are actually just watching me learning to do fancy stuff watching me learning to do fancy stuff watching me learning to do fancy stuff on the internet and I hope I don't mess on the internet and I hope I don't mess on the internet and I hope I don't mess up too much if I do I hope you can up too much if I do I hope you can up too much if I do I hope you can forgive me so this is this is the forgive me so this is this is the forgive me so this is this is the plotting anything with ggplot2 webinar plotting anything with ggplot2 webinar plotting anything with ggplot2 webinar the corona Edition but it simply means the corona Edition but it simply means the corona Edition but it simply means is that I figured we're all stuck at is that I figured we're all stuck at is that I figured we're all stuck at home or at least in a very peculiar home or at least in a very peculiar home or at least in a very peculiar situation right now and we we might as situation right now and we we might as situation right now and we we might as well try to make the best of it this was well try to make the best of it this was well try to make the best of it this was or this is like a four or five hour or this is like a four or five hour or this is like a four or five hour workshop we would won't do all of it workshop we would won't do all of it workshop we would won't do all of it today but we will we will take the first today but we will we will take the first today but we will we will take the first half so expect that this will take half so expect that this will take half so expect that this will take between two and three hours more or less between two and three hours more or less between two and three hours more or less and and then we'll take the later half and and then we'll take the later half and and then we'll take the later half at another convenient time my my at another convenient time my my at another convenient time my my planning and my schedule is also a bit a planning and my schedule is also a bit a planning and my schedule is also a bit a bit strained at the moment so hopefully bit strained at the moment so hopefully bit strained at the moment so hopefully sometime next week so just a quick word sometime next week so just a quick word sometime next week so just a quick word about me um my name is Thomas I'm a about me um my name is Thomas I'm a about me um my name is Thomas I'm a software engineer at our studio where I software engineer at our studio where I software engineer at our studio where I work mainly with with the graphics Tech work mainly with with the graphics Tech work mainly with with the graphics Tech in our I'm currently the I'm not the in our I'm currently the I'm not the in our I'm currently the I'm not the official maintainer of ggplot2 but I am official maintainer of ggplot2 but I am official maintainer of ggplot2 but I am one of the main maintainer of Gd plot to one of the main maintainer of Gd plot to one of the main maintainer of Gd plot to we're small team but I also work another we're small team but I also work another we're small team but I also work another graphic related stuff and and try to graphic related stuff and and try to graphic related stuff and and try to improve the the benchmarking a lot I was improve the the benchmarking a lot I was improve the the benchmarking a lot I was once a bioinformatician before I dived once a bioinformatician before I dived once a bioinformatician before I dived into the world of into the world of into the world of pure software engineering so I have that pure software engineering so I have that pure software engineering so I have that in my backpack and I do block a bit on in my backpack and I do block a bit on in my backpack and I do block a bit on data imagine Escom you can follow me on data imagine Escom you can follow me on data imagine Escom you can follow me on twitter which is also where you'll twitter which is also where you'll twitter which is also where you'll probably see the next date for the rest probably see the next date for the rest probably see the next date for the rest of the of this this webinar and I'm also of the of this this webinar and I'm also of the of this this webinar and I'm also on github obviously where you can you on github obviously where you can you on github obviously where you can you see all my my different projects so see all my my different projects so see all my my different projects so about today this evening this morning about today this evening this morning about today this evening this morning this night whatever time it is for you this night whatever time it is for you this night whatever time it is for you we're going to talk about four main we're going to talk about four main we're going to talk about four main sections the first we're going to talk sections the first we're going to talk sections the first we're going to talk about is the grammar of graphics if you about is the grammar of graphics if you about is the grammar of graphics if you don't if you have ever wondered why it's don't if you have ever wondered why it's don't if you have ever wondered why it's called ggplot it's because it's an called ggplot it's because it's an called ggplot it's because it's an implementation of grammar of graphics eg implementation of grammar of graphics eg implementation of grammar of graphics eg and then flooding of course and and the and then flooding of course and and the and then flooding of course and and the grammar of graphic is a theoretical grammar of graphic is a theoretical grammar of graphic is a theoretical construct so the first part will be construct so the first part will be construct so the first part will be purely theoretical if you if you look purely theoretical if you if you look purely theoretical if you if you look forward to getting into the nitty-gritty forward to getting into the nitty-gritty forward to getting into the nitty-gritty coding at the beginning I'm sorry to coding at the beginning I'm sorry to coding at the beginning I'm sorry to disappoint you my feeling is that it's disappoint you my feeling is that it's disappoint you my feeling is that it's it's extremely important to understand it's extremely important to understand it's extremely important to understand the the theory behind ggplot2 to learn the the theory behind ggplot2 to learn the the theory behind ggplot2 to learn to use it efficiently which is why I'm to use it efficiently which is why I'm to use it efficiently which is why I'm starting off in that way it's it's not starting off in that way it's it's not starting off in that way it's it's not gonna be too long and boring hopefully gonna be too long and boring hopefully gonna be too long and boring hopefully and I hope that you come out and the and I hope that you come out and the and I hope that you come out and the other end actually understanding why we other end actually understanding why we other end actually understanding why we do what we do in GT plot2 so but one do what we do in GT plot2 so but one do what we do in GT plot2 so but one thing is of course theory and then after thing is of course theory and then after thing is of course theory and then after this I'm going to talk about the ggplot2 this I'm going to talk about the ggplot2 this I'm going to talk about the ggplot2 API which is like the programmatic API which is like the programmatic API which is like the programmatic reflection of this theory and these are reflection of this theory and these are reflection of this theory and these are the two parts that we'll be discussing the two parts that we'll be discussing the two parts that we'll be discussing today and then in a later webinar I'm today and then in a later webinar I'm today and then in a later webinar I'm going to talk about what I'm calling going to talk about what I'm calling going to talk about what I'm calling beyond ggplot2 Gd plot two has has been beyond ggplot2 Gd plot two has has been beyond ggplot2 Gd plot two has has been successful in nurturing a quite quite successful in nurturing a quite quite successful in nurturing a quite quite vibrant ecosystem of additional packages vibrant ecosystem of additional packages vibrant ecosystem of additional packages that improve on the that improve on the that improve on the on the current ggplot2 what I would call on the current ggplot2 what I would call on the current ggplot2 what I would call base ggplot2 improving that by adding base ggplot2 improving that by adding base ggplot2 improving that by adding new features and new capabilities to the new features and new capabilities to the new features and new capabilities to the API and then in the end for the last day API and then in the end for the last day API and then in the end for the last day I will I'll talk about this idea of I will I'll talk about this idea of I will I'll talk about this idea of drawing anything like what how do we drawing anything like what how do we drawing anything like what how do we draw anything how how do we look at draw anything how how do we look at draw anything how how do we look at something and deconstruct it and figure something and deconstruct it and figure something and deconstruct it and figure out how could we possibly do this with out how could we possibly do this with out how could we possibly do this with ggplot2 okay so that's about today there ggplot2 okay so that's about today there ggplot2 okay so that's about today there is also a lot about not not about today is also a lot about not not about today is also a lot about not not about today which are all quite integral to working which are all quite integral to working which are all quite integral to working with our really and and therefore also with our really and and therefore also with our really and and therefore also quite integral to to working with data quite integral to to working with data quite integral to to working with data visualization and ggplot2 well we won't visualization and ggplot2 well we won't visualization and ggplot2 well we won't talk about it because it would simply be talk about it because it would simply be talk about it because it would simply be too much to to have in our in a workshop too much to to have in our in a workshop too much to to have in our in a workshop or webinar and there is also a lot of or webinar and there is also a lot of or webinar and there is also a lot of fantastic fantastic articles fantastic fantastic fantastic articles fantastic fantastic fantastic articles fantastic material online that you can that you material online that you can that you material online that you can that you can learn about so one important part can learn about so one important part can learn about so one important part about plotting of course is data about plotting of course is data about plotting of course is data important there are some packages here important there are some packages here important there are some packages here that you can look more into that's the that you can look more into that's the that you can look more into that's the readout package does it read excel readout package does it read excel readout package does it read excel package in Haven read RS is for tabular package in Haven read RS is for tabular package in Haven read RS is for tabular tabular data read excel is for reading tabular data read excel is for reading tabular data read excel is for reading excel files into into our Haven is for excel files into into our Haven is for excel files into into our Haven is for reading data from SAS and SPSS and so on reading data from SAS and SPSS and so on reading data from SAS and SPSS and so on so these are different ways of getting so these are different ways of getting so these are different ways of getting your data in sois and they all have web your data in sois and they all have web your data in sois and they all have web pages that you can you can look into pages that you can you can look into pages that you can you can look into yourself at a later time there is yourself at a later time there is yourself at a later time there is there's also data manipulation which is there's also data manipulation which is there's also data manipulation which is of course also absolutely important and of course also absolutely important and of course also absolutely important and I would say is probably what constitute I would say is probably what constitute I would say is probably what constitute around 80% of any any remote or any kind around 80% of any any remote or any kind around 80% of any any remote or any kind of complex data visualization a lot of of complex data visualization a lot of of complex data visualization a lot of it is simply just a data manipulation it is simply just a data manipulation it is simply just a data manipulation and we won't talk about it you can look and we won't talk about it you can look and we won't talk about it you can look into tidy and apply if you're into the into tidy and apply if you're into the into tidy and apply if you're into the tidy verse you can look into data table tidy verse you can look into data table tidy verse you can look into data table if you prefer that syntax I personally if you prefer that syntax I personally if you prefer that syntax I personally don't care what you choose they all have don't care what you choose they all have don't care what you choose they all have webpages they all have extensive webpages they all have extensive webpages they all have extensive documentation and so on documentation and so on documentation and so on and then we won't really talk that much and then we won't really talk that much and then we won't really talk that much about our programming in general like about our programming in general like about our programming in general like our as a programming language I do hope our as a programming language I do hope our as a programming language I do hope that you're a bit familiar with it that you're a bit familiar with it that you're a bit familiar with it because we're going to look at code because we're going to look at code because we're going to look at code obviously for for the next couple of obviously for for the next couple of obviously for for the next couple of times together but but won't really times together but but won't really times together but but won't really discuss how the syntax of our is and so discuss how the syntax of our is and so discuss how the syntax of our is and so on and I will it's a it's a fantastic on and I will it's a it's a fantastic on and I will it's a it's a fantastic time to not know anything about time to not know anything about time to not know anything about programming in the sense that there is a programming in the sense that there is a programming in the sense that there is a huge amount of free online material huge amount of free online material huge amount of free online material available alpha data science and available alpha data science and available alpha data science and advanced our programming and our advanced our programming and our advanced our programming and our packages are all excellent books written packages are all excellent books written packages are all excellent books written by Hadley Wickham who is also the the by Hadley Wickham who is also the the by Hadley Wickham who is also the the original author of ggplot2 and they are original author of ggplot2 and they are original author of ggplot2 and they are all available for free online so go read all available for free online so go read all available for free online so go read these even if you're a seasoned these even if you're a seasoned these even if you're a seasoned programmer I'm pretty sure you can even programmer I'm pretty sure you can even programmer I'm pretty sure you can even find things in there that you didn't find things in there that you didn't find things in there that you didn't know about and it will have more know about and it will have more know about and it will have more spillover to how effectively you are spillover to how effectively you are spillover to how effectively you are juicing ggplot2 but we will not talk juicing ggplot2 but we will not talk juicing ggplot2 but we will not talk about today so today we're going to to about today so today we're going to to about today so today we're going to to be working with well these slides but be working with well these slides but be working with well these slides but there will also be exercises you can there will also be exercises you can there will also be exercises you can head to this github repository with the head to this github repository with the head to this github repository with the links shown on screen and there will be links shown on screen and there will be links shown on screen and there will be both lease these slides will be there as both lease these slides will be there as both lease these slides will be there as a PDF but there will also be an hour a PDF but there will also be an hour a PDF but there will also be an hour markdown file that you can download and markdown file that you can download and markdown file that you can download and open up and there will be exercises it open up and there will be exercises it open up and there will be exercises it won't only be exercises there will also won't only be exercises there will also won't only be exercises there will also be code for all the different plots that be code for all the different plots that be code for all the different plots that I'm showing today so every time there is I'm showing today so every time there is I'm showing today so every time there is a code example and a plot that I'm a code example and a plot that I'm a code example and a plot that I'm showing you the code is actually there showing you the code is actually there showing you the code is actually there in the markdown file and you can execute in the markdown file and you can execute in the markdown file and you can execute them as we go which I will encourage you them as we go which I will encourage you them as we go which I will encourage you to do just to follow along executing the to do just to follow along executing the to do just to follow along executing the code as we talk about it it's a great code as we talk about it it's a great code as we talk about it it's a great way of getting into like accepting that way of getting into like accepting that way of getting into like accepting that it's not just my gospel but but it's it's not just my gospel but but it's it's not just my gospel but but it's actually it's true that when you execute actually it's true that when you execute actually it's true that when you execute this kind of code the output looks like this kind of code the output looks like this kind of code the output looks like this and a slight detour from from how I this and a slight detour from from how I this and a slight detour from from how I did it during the during the workshop is did it during the during the workshop is did it during the during the workshop is that that that we won't take off time for you to sit we won't take off time for you to sit we won't take off time for you to sit down and and solve the exercises instead down and and solve the exercises instead down and and solve the exercises instead I will live code them to the extent I will live code them to the extent I will live code them to the extent possible if you don't want me to spoil possible if you don't want me to spoil possible if you don't want me to spoil the solution for you you can simply just the solution for you you can simply just the solution for you you can simply just commute me if you're watching this at a commute me if you're watching this at a commute me if you're watching this at a later time because this is getting taped later time because this is getting taped later time because this is getting taped as well you can simply just pause the as well you can simply just pause the as well you can simply just pause the video and sit down and solve the video and sit down and solve the video and sit down and solve the exercises and then continue on with you exercises and then continue on with you exercises and then continue on with you with the with a screencast just to see with the with a screencast just to see with the with a screencast just to see if everything is working out we have if everything is working out we have if everything is working out we have this exercise our markdown file and this this exercise our markdown file and this this exercise our markdown file and this is this is what you can download from is this is what you can download from is this is what you can download from the workshop repository let us show you the workshop repository let us show you the workshop repository let us show you and if you're not familiar with with and if you're not familiar with with and if you're not familiar with with markdown files if you open an RD file up markdown files if you open an RD file up markdown files if you open an RD file up in in our studio you will see that it's in in our studio you will see that it's in in our studio you will see that it's a mix of pros like freeform text and a mix of pros like freeform text and a mix of pros like freeform text and then we have these kind of weird little then we have these kind of weird little then we have these kind of weird little back slashes and along with with some back slashes and along with with some back slashes and along with with some some different things and in inside here some different things and in inside here some different things and in inside here there are code and code like in here can there are code and code like in here can there are code and code like in here can actually be executed so if we just slide actually be executed so if we just slide actually be executed so if we just slide down to the first introduction here we down to the first introduction here we down to the first introduction here we can see that if you if you have your if can see that if you if you have your if can see that if you if you have your if you have a cursor on a line you can you have a cursor on a line you can you have a cursor on a line you can command or control and then enter and command or control and then enter and command or control and then enter and this will actually be executed as a this will actually be executed as a this will actually be executed as a normal our command and when you do that normal our command and when you do that normal our command and when you do that you can see that we get some output and you can see that we get some output and you can see that we get some output and usually the output in this in this usually the output in this in this usually the output in this in this workshop will be that of a plot and then workshop will be that of a plot and then workshop will be that of a plot and then you can just simply follow along as we you can just simply follow along as we you can just simply follow along as we go executing the curve and so on and so go executing the curve and so on and so go executing the curve and so on and so forth that's a great way of following forth that's a great way of following forth that's a great way of following along yeah and I will just jump back so along yeah and I will just jump back so along yeah and I will just jump back so someone asked what's the link to the someone asked what's the link to the someone asked what's the link to the github so the link to the github is back github so the link to the github is back github so the link to the github is back on it is on it is on it is yeah she have a link here that was a yeah she have a link here that was a yeah she have a link here that was a good good idea I am new to this so oops just give me a second so I just pasted in the link in the chat so I just pasted in the link in the chat so I just pasted in the link in the chat room for you okay so I will try to keep an eye on the on so I will try to keep an eye on the on so I will try to keep an eye on the on the chat but a lot of things is the chat but a lot of things is the chat but a lot of things is happening and it's probably better for happening and it's probably better for happening and it's probably better for me to to focus on what I'm going to say me to to focus on what I'm going to say me to to focus on what I'm going to say so if you have questions do put them in so if you have questions do put them in so if you have questions do put them in the in the chat but I cannot promise the in the chat but I cannot promise the in the chat but I cannot promise that I'll say I'll see them another that I'll say I'll see them another that I'll say I'll see them another thing that's related to that is that if thing that's related to that is that if thing that's related to that is that if you don't have questions and just want you don't have questions and just want you don't have questions and just want to say hello and so on it's probably to say hello and so on it's probably to say hello and so on it's probably best if you don't just because it will best if you don't just because it will best if you don't just because it will it will mean that whenever something is it will mean that whenever something is it will mean that whenever something is happening in this chat it will be a happening in this chat it will be a happening in this chat it will be a question and I'm more likely to see it question and I'm more likely to see it question and I'm more likely to see it okay okay okay I am absolutely amazed by all the people I am absolutely amazed by all the people I am absolutely amazed by all the people that are here and I'll just say hello that are here and I'll just say hello that are here and I'll just say hello like this and and and we'll leave it at like this and and and we'll leave it at like this and and and we'll leave it at that that that someone is asking what version of someone is asking what version of someone is asking what version of ggplot2 is needed and it's the recent ggplot2 is needed and it's the recent ggplot2 is needed and it's the recent version the three point three point oh version the three point three point oh version the three point three point oh that will be working on someone is that will be working on someone is that will be working on someone is asking do you have a delay I have no asking do you have a delay I have no asking do you have a delay I have no idea what that is so I probably don't idea what that is so I probably don't idea what that is so I probably don't it's our mock time stimulus ipython it's our mock time stimulus ipython it's our mock time stimulus ipython notebook yes it's quite similar so so notebook yes it's quite similar so so notebook yes it's quite similar so so you have you have code blocks and you you have you have code blocks and you you have you have code blocks and you have you have blocks of pure text which have you have blocks of pure text which have you have blocks of pure text which is not getting executed and you can you is not getting executed and you can you is not getting executed and you can you can just look at it as a as a text as a can just look at it as a as a text as a can just look at it as a as a text as a as a piece of a text file but you can as a piece of a text file but you can as a piece of a text file but you can also generate PDFs from it and so on and also generate PDFs from it and so on and also generate PDFs from it and so on and so forth perhaps just put the link in so forth perhaps just put the link in so forth perhaps just put the link in the description yes that's an excellent the description yes that's an excellent the description yes that's an excellent idea idea idea and I'll just do that there we go and I'll just do that there we go and I'll just do that there we go okay so anyway as you can probably see okay so anyway as you can probably see okay so anyway as you can probably see right now this is all new right now this is all new right now this is all new to me I have never done a screencast to me I have never done a screencast to me I have never done a screencast before so I will try to read through all before so I will try to read through all before so I will try to read through all your fantastic ideas and comments after your fantastic ideas and comments after your fantastic ideas and comments after I have given this and perhaps I'll be I have given this and perhaps I'll be I have given this and perhaps I'll be more educated about how to probably do more educated about how to probably do more educated about how to probably do this this this the next time so it's this lab coding the next time so it's this lab coding the next time so it's this lab coding you can you can sit in your own computer you can you can sit in your own computer you can you can sit in your own computer and and code with me if you want us to and and code with me if you want us to and and code with me if you want us to talked about and the video will be talked about and the video will be talked about and the video will be available later okay let's get going so available later okay let's get going so available later okay let's get going so let's see okay so let's dive into part let's see okay so let's dive into part let's see okay so let's dive into part one the grammar of graphics so the one the grammar of graphics so the one the grammar of graphics so the grammar of graphic is graphics it's not grammar of graphic is graphics it's not grammar of graphic is graphics it's not just something that kind of existed just something that kind of existed just something that kind of existed forever it's uh it's something that has forever it's uh it's something that has forever it's uh it's something that has been been developed by a guy named been been developed by a guy named been been developed by a guy named Leland Wilkinson and it has been been Leland Wilkinson and it has been been Leland Wilkinson and it has been been written about in his book the grammar of written about in his book the grammar of written about in his book the grammar of graphics and the first edition came out graphics and the first edition came out graphics and the first edition came out in 1999 which last time when I gave the in 1999 which last time when I gave the in 1999 which last time when I gave the workshop I said well so it's a pretty workshop I said well so it's a pretty workshop I said well so it's a pretty recent book and then I figure out that recent book and then I figure out that recent book and then I figure out that I'm just extremely old at this point I'm just extremely old at this point I'm just extremely old at this point which is kind of sad but but that's just which is kind of sad but but that's just which is kind of sad but but that's just how it is how it is how it is so the book is kind of interesting is so the book is kind of interesting is so the book is kind of interesting is the thirakkatha reticle deconstruction the thirakkatha reticle deconstruction the thirakkatha reticle deconstruction of data graphics so it's not really of data graphics so it's not really of data graphics so it's not really about how to how to plot things it's about how to how to plot things it's about how to how to plot things it's just about what is graphic Cistercian just about what is graphic Cistercian just about what is graphic Cistercian and and it's a it has been quite and and it's a it has been quite and and it's a it has been quite successful in that regard in the sense successful in that regard in the sense successful in that regard in the sense that it has been made the foundation for that it has been made the foundation for that it has been made the foundation for quite a lot of different graphics quite a lot of different graphics quite a lot of different graphics applications ggplot2 is the absolute applications ggplot2 is the absolute applications ggplot2 is the absolute obvious one but also the GUI program obvious one but also the GUI program obvious one but also the GUI program called Polaris which later turned into called Polaris which later turned into called Polaris which later turned into tableau and also Vega light and probably tableau and also Vega light and probably tableau and also Vega light and probably others as well so so in that sense it others as well so so in that sense it others as well so so in that sense it has been extremely successful in the has been extremely successful in the has been extremely successful in the goal that it set out to be which is goal that it set out to be which is goal that it set out to be which is exactly to create a better foundation exactly to create a better foundation exactly to create a better foundation for for software that provides api's for for for software that provides api's for for for software that provides api's for doing graphics so the book is kind of doing graphics so the book is kind of doing graphics so the book is kind of interested in the sense that it's not interested in the sense that it's not interested in the sense that it's not really interested in why like really interested in why like really interested in why like why should we choose this box yet why is why should we choose this box yet why is why should we choose this box yet why is a pie chart not as good as a bad shot or a pie chart not as good as a bad shot or a pie chart not as good as a bad shot or whatever like a lot of data whatever like a lot of data whatever like a lot of data visualization books are very very visualization books are very very visualization books are very very focused on this aspects it's a very focused on this aspects it's a very focused on this aspects it's a very important aspect but but not for this important aspect but but not for this important aspect but but not for this book like it it doesn't really care book like it it doesn't really care book like it it doesn't really care about it it's also not interested in about it it's also not interested in about it it's also not interested in beauty so it's not a book that you beauty so it's not a book that you beauty so it's not a book that you should read to figure out how to make should read to figure out how to make should read to figure out how to make like stunning beautiful charts it is like stunning beautiful charts it is like stunning beautiful charts it is also not really interested in algorithms also not really interested in algorithms also not really interested in algorithms like which algorithm should I use to to like which algorithm should I use to to like which algorithm should I use to to create the most efficient map plotting create the most efficient map plotting create the most efficient map plotting or whatever like it doesn't really care or whatever like it doesn't really care or whatever like it doesn't really care about that it is however very interested about that it is however very interested about that it is however very interested in how you design this system that then in how you design this system that then in how you design this system that then can allow all of this and the second can allow all of this and the second can allow all of this and the second chapter in the book after a brief chapter in the book after a brief chapter in the book after a brief introduction is really just how to make introduction is really just how to make introduction is really just how to make a pie like a pie chart not bake a pie a pie like a pie chart not bake a pie a pie like a pie chart not bake a pie and and and then this is just a whole and and and then this is just a whole and and and then this is just a whole chapter figuring out like like when we chapter figuring out like like when we chapter figuring out like like when we say we wants to make a patch out what do say we wants to make a patch out what do say we wants to make a patch out what do we have to think about and so on and the we have to think about and so on and the we have to think about and so on and the rest of the book is really just a rest of the book is really just a rest of the book is really just a deconstruction of this thought process deconstruction of this thought process deconstruction of this thought process trying to figure out how can we how can trying to figure out how can we how can trying to figure out how can we how can we generalize all of these a deer's and we generalize all of these a deer's and we generalize all of these a deer's and so on so on so on is it the book that you should like is it the book that you should like is it the book that you should like after this webinar just storm out and after this webinar just storm out and after this webinar just storm out and try to get a hold on probably not like try to get a hold on probably not like try to get a hold on probably not like if unless you have read like a dozen or if unless you have read like a dozen or if unless you have read like a dozen or two different visualization books I two different visualization books I two different visualization books I don't think it is that important like don't think it is that important like don't think it is that important like the importance of this book is really in the importance of this book is really in the importance of this book is really in the different programming packages that the different programming packages that the different programming packages that is this inspired and and you don't is this inspired and and you don't is this inspired and and you don't really need to read this book to really need to read this book to really need to read this book to understand ggplot2 or to understand big understand ggplot2 or to understand big understand ggplot2 or to understand big alive and so on but understanding a bit alive and so on but understanding a bit alive and so on but understanding a bit about the grammar of graphic is very about the grammar of graphic is very about the grammar of graphic is very very good when it comes to comes to very good when it comes to comes to very good when it comes to comes to understanding the API choices that that understanding the API choices that that understanding the API choices that that did you plot to makes for instance so did you plot to makes for instance so did you plot to makes for instance so the idea of the book is that before this the idea of the book is that before this the idea of the book is that before this book it was not like there weren't any book it was not like there weren't any book it was not like there weren't any theories about about plotting and theories about about plotting and theories about about plotting and visualization such but in general when visualization such but in general when visualization such but in general when it came to when it came to designing it came to when it came to designing it came to when it came to designing programs or programs or programs or api's for creating graphics the world api's for creating graphics the world api's for creating graphics the world was such that you had a you had a was such that you had a you had a was such that you had a you had a function that created a pie chart you function that created a pie chart you function that created a pie chart you had a function that created a power had a function that created a power had a function that created a power challenge function to create a LAN challenge function to create a LAN challenge function to create a LAN channel and so on and so forth and channel and so on and so forth and channel and so on and so forth and that's all well and good like you can that's all well and good like you can that's all well and good like you can get a lot of stuff done like this but get a lot of stuff done like this but get a lot of stuff done like this but what he set out to do instead was to say what he set out to do instead was to say what he set out to do instead was to say well this this is kind of stupid in the well this this is kind of stupid in the well this this is kind of stupid in the sense that we have more than four chat sense that we have more than four chat sense that we have more than four chat types and at some point this has become types and at some point this has become types and at some point this has become unmanageable so instead of seeing unmanageable so instead of seeing unmanageable so instead of seeing looking at these things as just separate looking at these things as just separate looking at these things as just separate entities he just said well these are all entities he just said well these are all entities he just said well these are all just representatives of graphics now just representatives of graphics now just representatives of graphics now this just kind of sounds like well this just kind of sounds like well this just kind of sounds like well that's all great but what is graphics that's all great but what is graphics that's all great but what is graphics and and well the rest of the book is and and well the rest of the book is and and well the rest of the book is really just about that really just about that really just about that what is graphics and and and how do you what is graphics and and and how do you what is graphics and and and how do you think about graphics how do you how do think about graphics how do you how do think about graphics how do you how do you talk about graphics like what's kind you talk about graphics like what's kind you talk about graphics like what's kind of capillary do you need and so on so of capillary do you need and so on so of capillary do you need and so on so the book is really a decomposition of the book is really a decomposition of the book is really a decomposition of graphics into its constituents and there graphics into its constituents and there graphics into its constituents and there is a lot of these these different plus is a lot of these these different plus is a lot of these these different plus that I'm showing here on the right where that I'm showing here on the right where that I'm showing here on the right where you have the different constituents they you have the different constituents they you have the different constituents they are all not in complete agreement and are all not in complete agreement and are all not in complete agreement and and my version is is earing to the side and my version is is earing to the side and my version is is earing to the side of the ggplot2 api doesn't really matter of the ggplot2 api doesn't really matter of the ggplot2 api doesn't really matter the the the main paths are all there the the the main paths are all there the the the main paths are all there anyway so there are all these different anyway so there are all these different anyway so there are all these different different paths to a graphic like their different paths to a graphic like their different paths to a graphic like their data mapping statistics scales and all data mapping statistics scales and all data mapping statistics scales and all that and if it doesn't make any sense to that and if it doesn't make any sense to that and if it doesn't make any sense to you right now don't worry we'll have you right now don't worry we'll have you right now don't worry we'll have hours to learn you about this but he hours to learn you about this but he hours to learn you about this but he figured out that there are these kind of figured out that there are these kind of figured out that there are these kind of cardinal ideas around around graphics cardinal ideas around around graphics cardinal ideas around around graphics and he also sat down and said well how and he also sat down and said well how and he also sat down and said well how old do all these things relate how does old do all these things relate how does old do all these things relate how does data relate to the rest of the plot and data relate to the rest of the plot and data relate to the rest of the plot and so on and so forth and this is really so on and so forth and this is really so on and so forth and this is really like the grammar of graphics right there like the grammar of graphics right there like the grammar of graphics right there in the same sense that a language in the same sense that a language in the same sense that a language grammar describes different types of grammar describes different types of grammar describes different types of words and different ways that they can words and different ways that they can words and different ways that they can be related to each other be related to each other be related to each other so it's a it's a theory around so it's a it's a theory around so it's a it's a theory around structure of language and the grammar of structure of language and the grammar of structure of language and the grammar of graphics is a theory around the graphics is a theory around the graphics is a theory around the structure of graphics okay so so what he structure of graphics okay so so what he structure of graphics okay so so what he came came forth with was this idea that came came forth with was this idea that came came forth with was this idea that we had we had to undo one side this idea we had we had to undo one side this idea we had we had to undo one side this idea that we have pie charts and bar chests that we have pie charts and bar chests that we have pie charts and bar chests and all this and then he came with this and all this and then he came with this and all this and then he came with this idea that well we don't talk about that idea that well we don't talk about that idea that well we don't talk about that over here we talk about themes and over here we talk about themes and over here we talk about themes and coordinates and facets and geometries coordinates and facets and geometries coordinates and facets and geometries and all that and as you look at this and all that and as you look at this and all that and as you look at this like his worldview seems much more like his worldview seems much more like his worldview seems much more complicated than the world worldview of complicated than the world worldview of complicated than the world worldview of pie charts outlines can afford right and pie charts outlines can afford right and pie charts outlines can afford right and that's fair like that's a fair criticism that's fair like that's a fair criticism that's fair like that's a fair criticism but but what you should think about is but but what you should think about is but but what you should think about is that I don't I don't think it takes too that I don't I don't think it takes too that I don't I don't think it takes too much imagination to figure out that much imagination to figure out that much imagination to figure out that there are there are more than four there are there are more than four there are there are more than four different chart types right and new ones different chart types right and new ones different chart types right and new ones are getting invented everyday and the are getting invented everyday and the are getting invented everyday and the interface to creating these these new interface to creating these these new interface to creating these these new plus comes from different people and so plus comes from different people and so plus comes from different people and so on so like it's not for bubbles to the on so like it's not for bubbles to the on so like it's not for bubbles to the left like it's it's a hundred bubbles or left like it's it's a hundred bubbles or left like it's it's a hundred bubbles or whatever and and in that kind of view whatever and and in that kind of view whatever and and in that kind of view then his idea of maybe eight or eight or then his idea of maybe eight or eight or then his idea of maybe eight or eight or ten different like fixed ideas cardinal ten different like fixed ideas cardinal ten different like fixed ideas cardinal ideas about graphics doesn't seem so ideas about graphics doesn't seem so ideas about graphics doesn't seem so complicated at all right because the complicated at all right because the complicated at all right because the great thing about the grammar of graphic great thing about the grammar of graphic great thing about the grammar of graphic is that it applies to every type of club is that it applies to every type of club is that it applies to every type of club like there is there's no theoretical like there is there's no theoretical like there is there's no theoretical hindrance for the grammar of graphics to hindrance for the grammar of graphics to hindrance for the grammar of graphics to not be able to describe any type of plot not be able to describe any type of plot not be able to describe any type of plot in existence now whether the API in existence now whether the API in existence now whether the API supports that doesn't that's a different supports that doesn't that's a different supports that doesn't that's a different discussion and and it doesn't support discussion and and it doesn't support discussion and and it doesn't support everything but it it does support a fair everything but it it does support a fair everything but it it does support a fair amount of things right so if we go just amount of things right so if we go just amount of things right so if we go just briefly go through these different briefly go through these different briefly go through these different different ideas briefly I don't know but but at least see my briefly in the but at least see my briefly in the but at least see my briefly in the bottom of everything is data like bottom of everything is data like bottom of everything is data like without data you don't have without data you don't have without data you don't have data visualization you have may be you data visualization you have may be you data visualization you have may be you may may have a graphics or whatever but may may have a graphics or whatever but may may have a graphics or whatever but even a graphics without data is kind of even a graphics without data is kind of even a graphics without data is kind of boring right so data is is like this so boring right so data is is like this so boring right so data is is like this so most important thing in in data most important thing in in data most important thing in in data visualization and data is not just data visualization and data is not just data visualization and data is not just data like the representation of data kind of like the representation of data kind of like the representation of data kind of defines what you can do with it and and defines what you can do with it and and defines what you can do with it and and even though like the idea of Tidy data even though like the idea of Tidy data even though like the idea of Tidy data was not that like it didn't exist at was not that like it didn't exist at was not that like it didn't exist at that point the grammar as C's describes that point the grammar as C's describes that point the grammar as C's describes it kind of requires a tidy format he it kind of requires a tidy format he it kind of requires a tidy format he talks about having accesses to the talks about having accesses to the talks about having accesses to the different variables in the data that different variables in the data that different variables in the data that would return like victor type would return like victor type would return like victor type information so this is kind of the same information so this is kind of the same information so this is kind of the same as as a data tidy data frame right so as as a data tidy data frame right so as as a data tidy data frame right so data is super important we will not talk data is super important we will not talk data is super important we will not talk more about it but it is super super more about it but it is super super more about it but it is super super important the reason why we won't talk important the reason why we won't talk important the reason why we won't talk too much about it is because as we as we too much about it is because as we as we too much about it is because as we as we started out with there is simply too started out with there is simply too started out with there is simply too much to discuss about getting data much to discuss about getting data much to discuss about getting data inside into your programming language inside into your programming language inside into your programming language manipulating data and so on so we will manipulating data and so on so we will manipulating data and so on so we will not go into it but data is kind of a big not go into it but data is kind of a big not go into it but data is kind of a big deal right so once you have data you deal right so once you have data you deal right so once you have data you have to inform the graphics about how have to inform the graphics about how have to inform the graphics about how does the data fit into all of this and does the data fit into all of this and does the data fit into all of this and that's that's where the mapping come in that's that's where the mapping come in that's that's where the mapping come in and and the mapping is simply to say and and the mapping is simply to say and and the mapping is simply to say that we have some kind of data set let's that we have some kind of data set let's that we have some kind of data set let's call it iris and and then this iris call it iris and and then this iris call it iris and and then this iris dataset has I could call them called dataset has I could call them called dataset has I could call them called pizza length and pita width and see the pizza length and pita width and see the pizza length and pita width and see the length and siebel with you of course you length and siebel with you of course you length and siebel with you of course you don't really have any any programming don't really have any any programming don't really have any any programming API that knows about the column names of API that knows about the column names of API that knows about the column names of a virus and you don't really have any a virus and you don't really have any a virus and you don't really have any any don't really have any programming any don't really have any programming any don't really have any programming api's that expects your data input to be api's that expects your data input to be api's that expects your data input to be named a certain way like that would just named a certain way like that would just named a certain way like that would just be horribly be horribly be horribly inefficient so the mapping is what inefficient so the mapping is what inefficient so the mapping is what informs the graphics that well this informs the graphics that well this informs the graphics that well this column in the data means this and this column in the data means this and this column in the data means this and this column in the data means that and when column in the data means that and when column in the data means that and when I'm talking like that I'm talking about I'm talking like that I'm talking about I'm talking like that I'm talking about aesthetic mappings we'll get into to aesthetic mappings we'll get into to aesthetic mappings we'll get into to what aesthetics are later on but but what aesthetics are later on but but what aesthetics are later on but but really it's linking variables and the really it's linking variables and the really it's linking variables and the data to the graphical properties in the data to the graphical properties in the data to the graphical properties in the geometries so for instance this column geometries so for instance this column geometries so for instance this column represents what should be the X X values represents what should be the X X values represents what should be the X X values the x axis this variable represents what the x axis this variable represents what the x axis this variable represents what should be the color this variable should be the color this variable should be the color this variable represents what should be the size and represents what should be the size and represents what should be the size and so on there's the different kind of so on there's the different kind of so on there's the different kind of mapping in ggplot2 at least which is the mapping in ggplot2 at least which is the mapping in ggplot2 at least which is the facet mapping faceting is a fantastic facet mapping faceting is a fantastic facet mapping faceting is a fantastic thing that as you can see it's just four thing that as you can see it's just four thing that as you can see it's just four four paths on top of mapping in the in four paths on top of mapping in the in four paths on top of mapping in the in the stack and faceting is really about the stack and faceting is really about the stack and faceting is really about assigning data subsets into different assigning data subsets into different assigning data subsets into different views and in facet mapping is the idea views and in facet mapping is the idea views and in facet mapping is the idea that you're also using variables in your that you're also using variables in your that you're also using variables in your data set to define this this subset data set to define this this subset data set to define this this subset mapping this is all seems kind of weird mapping this is all seems kind of weird mapping this is all seems kind of weird but it it becomes more more clear when but it it becomes more more clear when but it it becomes more more clear when we begin to look at it and ggplot2 I'm we begin to look at it and ggplot2 I'm we begin to look at it and ggplot2 I'm using I'm using keynote for the slides yes it was just because there was yes it was just because there was yes it was just because there was someone asking for it so after the someone asking for it so after the someone asking for it so after the mapping after we we kind of have mapping after we we kind of have mapping after we we kind of have informed the data visualization where informed the data visualization where informed the data visualization where should grab all the values from the data should grab all the values from the data should grab all the values from the data room we have something called statistics room we have something called statistics room we have something called statistics and and this is something we will delve and and this is something we will delve and and this is something we will delve into a bit more later on because I think into a bit more later on because I think into a bit more later on because I think statistics is some of the something that statistics is some of the something that statistics is some of the something that trips people have a lot in in G plot too trips people have a lot in in G plot too trips people have a lot in in G plot too but in general the idea of statistics is but in general the idea of statistics is but in general the idea of statistics is that even though we may have a fantastic that even though we may have a fantastic that even though we may have a fantastic representation of the data in a tidy representation of the data in a tidy representation of the data in a tidy format and all that the data as we pass format and all that the data as we pass format and all that the data as we pass in may not represent the values that we in may not represent the values that we in may not represent the values that we want to display want to display want to display for instance if we have a we have a bad for instance if we have a we have a bad for instance if we have a we have a bad shot the bass will usually represent shot the bass will usually represent shot the bass will usually represent camps and sure you can you can pass in camps and sure you can you can pass in camps and sure you can you can pass in some data that already has the counts some data that already has the counts some data that already has the counts pre-calculated but you can just as well pre-calculated but you can just as well pre-calculated but you can just as well pass in some data that just haven't have pass in some data that just haven't have pass in some data that just haven't have a row for each observation and you want a row for each observation and you want a row for each observation and you want to let the visualization software method to let the visualization software method to let the visualization software method automatically and the statistics is automatically and the statistics is automatically and the statistics is exactly that that we apply some sort of exactly that that we apply some sort of exactly that that we apply some sort of calculations to the data to transform it calculations to the data to transform it calculations to the data to transform it into some new values and these values into some new values and these values into some new values and these values are then whatever is going to be be are then whatever is going to be be are then whatever is going to be be plotted so batch has one thing if we plotted so batch has one thing if we plotted so batch has one thing if we have a boxplot for instance like this is have a boxplot for instance like this is have a boxplot for instance like this is retro these have like five different retro these have like five different retro these have like five different values that represents the distribution values that represents the distribution values that represents the distribution of some data and you really don't want of some data and you really don't want of some data and you really don't want to calculate that before you begin to calculate that before you begin to calculate that before you begin plotting so you need the statistics to plotting so you need the statistics to plotting so you need the statistics to statistics to to do that for you before statistics to to do that for you before statistics to to do that for you before we can get into actually drawing the we can get into actually drawing the we can get into actually drawing the thing right and for a lot of plot types thing right and for a lot of plot types thing right and for a lot of plot types this is kind of implicit like you don't this is kind of implicit like you don't this is kind of implicit like you don't think about the statistics which is also think about the statistics which is also think about the statistics which is also why it kind of trips up a lot of people why it kind of trips up a lot of people why it kind of trips up a lot of people and they can often be done for price and they can often be done for price and they can often be done for price plotting but but usually it doesn't so plotting but but usually it doesn't so plotting but but usually it doesn't so when you do a box plot you don't really when you do a box plot you don't really when you do a box plot you don't really think about that it has to calculate think about that it has to calculate think about that it has to calculate these values it just kind of knows where these values it just kind of knows where these values it just kind of knows where to put the different lines and boxes and to put the different lines and boxes and to put the different lines and boxes and so on right well the statistics is doing so on right well the statistics is doing so on right well the statistics is doing all that next up is scales and most all that next up is scales and most all that next up is scales and most often when you have some data the data often when you have some data the data often when you have some data the data it does not directly represent like the it does not directly represent like the it does not directly represent like the graphical properties it's it's very graphical properties it's it's very graphical properties it's it's very seldom that you have a variable in your seldom that you have a variable in your seldom that you have a variable in your data set that is that has the name data set that is that has the name data set that is that has the name square and triangle and circle in it but square and triangle and circle in it but square and triangle and circle in it but sometimes you want to display the points sometimes you want to display the points sometimes you want to display the points with different shapes so you have to with different shapes so you have to with different shapes so you have to figure out like I don't have this column figure out like I don't have this column figure out like I don't have this column in my in my data set but I want like in my in my data set but I want like in my in my data set but I want like this this column that represents some this this column that represents some this this column that represents some different values it could be different values it could be different values it could be gender or it could be whatever and I gender or it could be whatever and I gender or it could be whatever and I want that to be represented by shape for want that to be represented by shape for want that to be represented by shape for instance so we have to apply a scale to instance so we have to apply a scale to instance so we have to apply a scale to it that map's between like our data it that map's between like our data it that map's between like our data input and into something that is is a input and into something that is is a input and into something that is is a graphic representing so so a scale graphic representing so so a scale graphic representing so so a scale translate back and forth between like translate back and forth between like translate back and forth between like the the ranges of variables and the the the the ranges of variables and the the the the ranges of variables and the the property ranges that you have so for property ranges that you have so for property ranges that you have so for instance if you have categories it can instance if you have categories it can instance if you have categories it can be different types of caste for instance be different types of caste for instance be different types of caste for instance and you want to to represent them as and you want to to represent them as and you want to to represent them as color then you say well this scale takes color then you say well this scale takes color then you say well this scale takes care of translating Oddie to red and care of translating Oddie to red and care of translating Oddie to red and Mercedes to blue and so on and so forth Mercedes to blue and so on and so forth Mercedes to blue and so on and so forth and it can actually also translate back and it can actually also translate back and it can actually also translate back so it knows that blue is actually so it knows that blue is actually so it knows that blue is actually Mercedes and and red is actually Mercedes and and red is actually Mercedes and and red is actually audience so on but it's not only audience so on but it's not only audience so on but it's not only categories of course like if you pass in categories of course like if you pass in categories of course like if you pass in numbers numbers numbers those are those are continuous and it those are those are continuous and it those are those are continuous and it can be used for continuous graphical can be used for continuous graphical can be used for continuous graphical properties for instance if if you want properties for instance if if you want properties for instance if if you want to map something to the x-axis we have to map something to the x-axis we have to map something to the x-axis we have numbers and we and we translate that numbers and we and we translate that numbers and we and we translate that into positions and that is eye deep deep into positions and that is eye deep deep into positions and that is eye deep deep beneath it all it's it's mapping it to a beneath it all it's it's mapping it to a beneath it all it's it's mapping it to a zero to one interval that kind of scales zero to one interval that kind of scales zero to one interval that kind of scales it correctly inside the plotting region it correctly inside the plotting region it correctly inside the plotting region but that's just technicalities and the but that's just technicalities and the but that's just technicalities and the scales kind of imply that there's scales kind of imply that there's scales kind of imply that there's there's differences between data like there's differences between data like there's differences between data like data can have can have different types data can have can have different types data can have can have different types data can be discrete like categories it data can be discrete like categories it data can be discrete like categories it can be continuous like numbers it can be can be continuous like numbers it can be can be continuous like numbers it can be some specific type like like a date or a some specific type like like a date or a some specific type like like a date or a time or whatever it can be an ordered time or whatever it can be an ordered time or whatever it can be an ordered factor and so on and the different type factor and so on and the different type factor and so on and the different type of scales actually specified the of scales actually specified the of scales actually specified the interpretation of the values right okay so now we're getting to like the meat of so now we're getting to like the meat of so now we're getting to like the meat of it which is geometries really this is at it which is geometries really this is at it which is geometries really this is at least when you when you're using ggplot2 least when you when you're using ggplot2 least when you when you're using ggplot2 German Teresa's is more or less all you German Teresa's is more or less all you German Teresa's is more or less all you think about most of the time and think about most of the time and think about most of the time and geometries take care of taking all these geometries take care of taking all these geometries take care of taking all these scale values that comes from the mapping scale values that comes from the mapping scale values that comes from the mapping that may have been transformed by a that may have been transformed by a that may have been transformed by a statistics and say well I'm thankful statistics and say well I'm thankful statistics and say well I'm thankful that you give me all these values I'm that you give me all these values I'm that you give me all these values I'm going to interpret all of these values going to interpret all of these values going to interpret all of these values in a specific way so for instance a in a specific way so for instance a in a specific way so for instance a point geometry will take all these point geometry will take all these point geometry will take all these values x and y values maybe sighs maybe values x and y values maybe sighs maybe values x and y values maybe sighs maybe color and so on and just draw some color and so on and just draw some color and so on and just draw some points on your plot whereas a geom line points on your plot whereas a geom line points on your plot whereas a geom line or aligned jeremy tree will take exactly or aligned jeremy tree will take exactly or aligned jeremy tree will take exactly the same data but it will connect them the same data but it will connect them the same data but it will connect them right so so the same data input can have right so so the same data input can have right so so the same data input can have a vast array of different geometric a vast array of different geometric a vast array of different geometric representation and the geometries are representation and the geometries are representation and the geometries are really how you specify that so there are really how you specify that so there are really how you specify that so there are some base geometries like pointers we some base geometries like pointers we some base geometries like pointers we talked about line polygons these are all talked about line polygons these are all talked about line polygons these are all kind of of basic building blocks but we kind of of basic building blocks but we kind of of basic building blocks but we can also have more complex geometries can also have more complex geometries can also have more complex geometries like a boxplot geometries takes the like a boxplot geometries takes the like a boxplot geometries takes the calculator statistics from the boxplot calculator statistics from the boxplot calculator statistics from the boxplot statistics and it understands them and statistics and it understands them and statistics and it understands them and knows that it should both create a knows that it should both create a knows that it should both create a rectangle and some lines and so on and rectangle and some lines and so on and rectangle and some lines and so on and so forth so forth so forth and the geometries are to a very high and the geometries are to a very high and the geometries are to a very high degree what defines what your type of degree what defines what your type of degree what defines what your type of plot is now is that just simply the same plot is now is that just simply the same plot is now is that just simply the same idea that we have bar charts and line idea that we have bar charts and line idea that we have bar charts and line charts and so on so now we just stuck charts and so on so now we just stuck charts and so on so now we just stuck with bar geometries and line geometries with bar geometries and line geometries with bar geometries and line geometries and no so on well kind of more done and no so on well kind of more done and no so on well kind of more done exactly and one of the things is that exactly and one of the things is that exactly and one of the things is that that plus are not limited to two single that plus are not limited to two single that plus are not limited to two single geometries and you can have multiple geometries and you can have multiple geometries and you can have multiple layers of different geometries but also layers of different geometries but also layers of different geometries but also right now we have we have kind of right now we have we have kind of right now we have we have kind of extracted all the extracted all the extracted all the things that also goes into a bar chart things that also goes into a bar chart things that also goes into a bar chart or a pie chart or whatever and put them or a pie chart or whatever and put them or a pie chart or whatever and put them into something that's shareable between into something that's shareable between into something that's shareable between different different geometries like the different different geometries like the different different geometries like the scales and statistics and mapping and so scales and statistics and mapping and so scales and statistics and mapping and so on so we talked briefly about fascist on so we talked briefly about fascist on so we talked briefly about fascist when we talked about mapping so facets when we talked about mapping so facets when we talked about mapping so facets is the idea is that when you have a plot is the idea is that when you have a plot is the idea is that when you have a plot you have some flooding area and usually you have some flooding area and usually you have some flooding area and usually you just have a single plotting area but you just have a single plotting area but you just have a single plotting area but you're not really confined to only you're not really confined to only you're not really confined to only having a single flooding area you may having a single flooding area you may having a single flooding area you may want to split out your data into into want to split out your data into into want to split out your data into into multiple smaller multiples as what is multiple smaller multiples as what is multiple smaller multiples as what is called an in data visualization of the called an in data visualization of the called an in data visualization of the same type of plot and this is a same type of plot and this is a same type of plot and this is a fantastic thing to do and we'll we'll fantastic thing to do and we'll we'll fantastic thing to do and we'll we'll talk more about when we get into how to talk more about when we get into how to talk more about when we get into how to do it with ggplot2 do it with ggplot2 do it with ggplot2 but basically it allows you to to but basically it allows you to to but basically it allows you to to declutter your data and it allows your declutter your data and it allows your declutter your data and it allows your brain to reuse the ideas that it has brain to reuse the ideas that it has brain to reuse the ideas that it has from one of the Plus and apply it to the from one of the Plus and apply it to the from one of the Plus and apply it to the other subplots and the panel layout like other subplots and the panel layout like other subplots and the panel layout like the layout of the small Sun plus may the layout of the small Sun plus may the layout of the small Sun plus may actually have meaning so so you can have actually have meaning so so you can have actually have meaning so so you can have a you can have a layout that in and of a you can have a layout that in and of a you can have a layout that in and of itself carries some additional meaning itself carries some additional meaning itself carries some additional meaning so the facets are a kind of a weird so the facets are a kind of a weird so the facets are a kind of a weird concept that that is kind of unique to concept that that is kind of unique to concept that that is kind of unique to to the grammar of traffic in that sense to the grammar of traffic in that sense to the grammar of traffic in that sense but it says an extremely powerful but it says an extremely powerful but it says an extremely powerful feature and especially when you want to feature and especially when you want to feature and especially when you want to investigate adjacent like when you're investigate adjacent like when you're investigate adjacent like when you're doing plot driven data and investigation doing plot driven data and investigation doing plot driven data and investigation it's like and almost the last we have it's like and almost the last we have it's like and almost the last we have coordinates and coordinates a kind of an coordinates and coordinates a kind of an coordinates and coordinates a kind of an interesting thing right because for a interesting thing right because for a interesting thing right because for a lot of people coordinates and scales are lot of people coordinates and scales are lot of people coordinates and scales are kind of the same because we're doing kind of the same because we're doing kind of the same because we're doing scaling both of like for color but we scaling both of like for color but we scaling both of like for color but we also do it for positional things but also do it for positional things but also do it for positional things but positional aesthetics are kind of positional aesthetics are kind of positional aesthetics are kind of special because variables after they're being scaled variables after they're being scaled variables after they're being scaled they have passed the geometries and the they have passed the geometries and the they have passed the geometries and the journals free to say well I know what journals free to say well I know what journals free to say well I know what I'm going to do with this I'm just going I'm going to do with this I'm just going I'm going to do with this I'm just going to plot them but right before it's to plot them but right before it's to plot them but right before it's getting going to plot these things the getting going to plot these things the getting going to plot these things the positional aesthetics the X&amp;Y well used positional aesthetics the X&amp;Y well used positional aesthetics the X&amp;Y well used or the e everything related to position or the e everything related to position or the e everything related to position it's actually passed through the the it's actually passed through the the it's actually passed through the the coordinate system and the coordinate coordinate system and the coordinate coordinate system and the coordinate system is kind of the it's a physical system is kind of the it's a physical system is kind of the it's a physical mapping of the aesthetics onto the paper mapping of the aesthetics onto the paper mapping of the aesthetics onto the paper or onto the screen so so it's kind of or onto the screen so so it's kind of or onto the screen so so it's kind of the fabric that you're plotting stuff the fabric that you're plotting stuff the fabric that you're plotting stuff into and usually a lot of people will into and usually a lot of people will into and usually a lot of people will not really think about this because not really think about this because not really think about this because we're used to having this Cartesian we're used to having this Cartesian we're used to having this Cartesian coordinate system where we have a coordinate system where we have a coordinate system where we have a horizontal x-axis and vertical y-axis horizontal x-axis and vertical y-axis horizontal x-axis and vertical y-axis right and that's all we think about but right and that's all we think about but right and that's all we think about but if you're into photography and spatial if you're into photography and spatial if you're into photography and spatial stuff you will know that the world is stuff you will know that the world is stuff you will know that the world is not that simple it's it's quite hard to not that simple it's it's quite hard to not that simple it's it's quite hard to to map a globular world down to to a to map a globular world down to to a to map a globular world down to to a flat 2d surface so there's a lot of flat 2d surface so there's a lot of flat 2d surface so there's a lot of different ways that this can be done and different ways that this can be done and different ways that this can be done and even though we are having the same kind even though we are having the same kind even though we are having the same kind of latitude and longitude data there's a of latitude and longitude data there's a of latitude and longitude data there's a lot of different ways that this can lot of different ways that this can lot of different ways that this can actually be interpreted and the actually be interpreted and the actually be interpreted and the coordinate system kind of takes care of coordinate system kind of takes care of coordinate system kind of takes care of this when we're talking about this when we're talking about this when we're talking about cartography with we're usually talking cartography with we're usually talking cartography with we're usually talking about different projections but but what about different projections but but what about different projections but but what it really is it's it's different it really is it's it's different it really is it's it's different coordinate systems right you can so coordinate systems right you can so coordinate systems right you can so coordinates are specific to coordinate coordinates are specific to coordinate coordinates are specific to coordinate systems are specific to the positional systems are specific to the positional systems are specific to the positional aesthetics there are not really aesthetics there are not really aesthetics there are not really something that is similar in the same something that is similar in the same something that is similar in the same same sense for the other different same sense for the other different same sense for the other different aesthetics I would say it's mainly aesthetics I would say it's mainly aesthetics I would say it's mainly similar to a color profile if you know similar to a color profile if you know similar to a color profile if you know about color theory because the scale about color theory because the scale about color theory because the scale kind of just Maps things like data input kind of just Maps things like data input kind of just Maps things like data input to actual colors like red blue yellow to actual colors like red blue yellow to actual colors like red blue yellow whatever maybe even RGB values but what whatever maybe even RGB values but what whatever maybe even RGB values but what what these RGB values actually mean on a what these RGB values actually mean on a what these RGB values actually mean on a piece of paper depends on the different piece of paper depends on the different piece of paper depends on the different color profiles that you're used to color profiles that you're used to color profiles that you're used to printing it with so in that sense it's printing it with so in that sense it's printing it with so in that sense it's like a second layer of translation after like a second layer of translation after like a second layer of translation after you've done the scaling and and that's you've done the scaling and and that's you've done the scaling and and that's kind of the same as the coordinate kind of the same as the coordinate kind of the same as the coordinate system you don't really have any say in system you don't really have any say in system you don't really have any say in that when you're when with colors that when you're when with colors that when you're when with colors because it's just like the printer and because it's just like the printer and because it's just like the printer and your software that takes care of all your software that takes care of all your software that takes care of all that so but it's kind of the same that so but it's kind of the same that so but it's kind of the same constant right and in the end the very constant right and in the end the very constant right and in the end the very least and and also kind of the least least and and also kind of the least least and and also kind of the least important thing I would say is the important thing I would say is the important thing I would say is the theming and this is really like we theming and this is really like we theming and this is really like we haven't talked about the visual look of haven't talked about the visual look of haven't talked about the visual look of the plot up until now and that's because the plot up until now and that's because the plot up until now and that's because it doesn't really flow from the data it doesn't really flow from the data it doesn't really flow from the data itself like which fun should you use itself like which fun should you use itself like which fun should you use like what's the color of the background like what's the

so on and so on all of these things are not related to all of these things are not related to all of these things are not related to the data those are related to your the data those are related to your the data those are related to your aesthetic sense and what you want to do aesthetic sense and what you want to do aesthetic sense and what you want to do with your plot maybe you are going to to with your plot maybe you are going to to with your plot maybe you are going to to publish it in some some some venue that publish it in some some some venue that publish it in some some some venue that has its own style guide and you have to has its own style guide and you have to has its own style guide and you have to adhere to that and all that all of these adhere to that and all that all of these adhere to that and all that all of these things are things that that doesn't things are things that that doesn't things are things that that doesn't really matter in terms of interpreting really matter in terms of interpreting really matter in terms of interpreting in the plot it's just visual flourish in the plot it's just visual flourish in the plot it's just visual flourish now that doesn't mean it's not important now that doesn't mean it's not important now that doesn't mean it's not important of course aesthetically pleasing plots of course aesthetically pleasing plots of course aesthetically pleasing plots are absolutely much more easy to read are absolutely much more easy to read are absolutely much more easy to read and and likeable than Aquaplus so you and and likeable than Aquaplus so you and and likeable than Aquaplus so you should invest some time in it but on the should invest some time in it but on the should invest some time in it but on the other hand it's it's not something that other hand it's it's not something that other hand it's it's not something that is important in a sense of how how do we is important in a sense of how how do we is important in a sense of how how do we learn to plus stuff with with DB plot to learn to plus stuff with with DB plot to learn to plus stuff with with DB plot to or or with any other planning system I can see right now that I I don't really can see right now that I I don't really can see right now that I I don't really have time to to look at the chat window have time to to look at the chat window have time to to look at the chat window so I am sorry if there's been an extreme so I am sorry if there's been an extreme so I am sorry if there's been an extreme amount of questions and I haven't seen amount of questions and I haven't seen amount of questions and I haven't seen them I'm guessing that's just how it's them I'm guessing that's just how it's them I'm guessing that's just how it's going to be right now okay so we have going to be right now okay so we have going to be right now okay so we have gone through the grammar of graphics in gone through the grammar of graphics in gone through the grammar of graphics in a quite healthy pace and you may sit a quite healthy pace and you may sit a quite healthy pace and you may sit back and think well I just wanted to back and think well I just wanted to back and think well I just wanted to make a pie chart make a pie chart make a pie chart and all this is just like oh my god this and all this is just like oh my god this and all this is just like oh my god this is so so so so boring and theoretical is so so so so boring and theoretical is so so so so boring and theoretical and so on it let me just make a patch and so on it let me just make a patch and so on it let me just make a patch out and and we get to that and we get to out and and we get to that and we get to out and and we get to that and we get to getting to it now getting to it now getting to it now well not the pie chart part actually well not the pie chart part actually well not the pie chart part actually well we'll get to that in the end of the well we'll get to that in the end of the well we'll get to that in the end of the second part of this this webinar but at second part of this this webinar but at second part of this this webinar but at least other chat types so we have least other chat types so we have least other chat types so we have arrived at ggplot2 now I hope you're arrived at ggplot2 now I hope you're arrived at ggplot2 now I hope you're still awake I hope you haven't left me still awake I hope you haven't left me still awake I hope you haven't left me talking to myself because we are all talking to myself because we are all talking to myself because we are all here to learn about the G+ - API right here to learn about the G+ - API right here to learn about the G+ - API right and what did you plot - is is what's all and what did you plot - is is what's all and what did you plot - is is what's all about and and what we have to think about and and what we have to think about and and what we have to think about is that the grammar of graphics is about is that the grammar of graphics is about is that the grammar of graphics is really just a theoretical design system really just a theoretical design system really just a theoretical design system and ggplot2 is an implementation and and ggplot2 is an implementation and and ggplot2 is an implementation and that's quite important because Headley's that's quite important because Headley's that's quite important because Headley's ideas about the grammar of graphics it's ideas about the grammar of graphics it's ideas about the grammar of graphics it's not completely equivalent to little and not completely equivalent to little and not completely equivalent to little and Wilkinson's ideas of a gram of traffic Wilkinson's ideas of a gram of traffic Wilkinson's ideas of a gram of traffic part of that is that Leyland didn't have part of that is that Leyland didn't have part of that is that Leyland didn't have to actually invent a plotting a plotting to actually invent a plotting a plotting to actually invent a plotting a plotting system and Headley had to and and at system and Headley had to and and at system and Headley had to and and at some point life just gets in the way some point life just gets in the way some point life just gets in the way like you have to figure out how to how like you have to figure out how to how like you have to figure out how to how something works and it's actually usable something works and it's actually usable something works and it's actually usable and you may have to make concessions you and you may have to make concessions you and you may have to make concessions you may have to rethink stuff Gd plot 2 has may have to rethink stuff Gd plot 2 has may have to rethink stuff Gd plot 2 has had to do that and actually continues to had to do that and actually continues to had to do that and actually continues to do it because ggplot2 is getting do it because ggplot2 is getting do it because ggplot2 is getting continuously developed and and we figure continuously developed and and we figure continuously developed and and we figure out new ideas a long way but and the out new ideas a long way but and the out new ideas a long way but and the important part is that that well this important part is that that well this important part is that that well this period of the grammar of graphics lives period of the grammar of graphics lives period of the grammar of graphics lives lives on and if you understand the lives on and if you understand the lives on and if you understand the grammar of graphics you understand that grammar of graphics you understand that grammar of graphics you understand that you put to implementation as well there you put to implementation as well there you put to implementation as well there are just sometimes technicalities that are just sometimes technicalities that are just sometimes technicalities that differs a bit and as we talked about differs a bit and as we talked about differs a bit and as we talked about before ggplot2 is not like it's not the before ggplot2 is not like it's not the before ggplot2 is not like it's not the only implementation of only implementation of only implementation of przemek graphics like tableau and the przemek graphics like tableau and the przemek graphics like tableau and the Alliance also out there and and and Alliance also out there and and and Alliance also out there and and and certainly there are the flooding systems certainly there are the flooding systems certainly there are the flooding systems that that that uses the same ideas that that that uses the same ideas that that that uses the same ideas I think ggplot2 was one of the the first I think ggplot2 was one of the the first I think ggplot2 was one of the the first ones that that came became that became ones that that came became that became ones that that came became that became big and widely recognized and I think big and widely recognized and I think big and widely recognized and I think also that g2 has probably inspired a lot also that g2 has probably inspired a lot also that g2 has probably inspired a lot of the other implementations in that of the other implementations in that of the other implementations in that regard but ggplot2 is not like the the regard but ggplot2 is not like the the regard but ggplot2 is not like the the only idea that you can about how you can only idea that you can about how you can only idea that you can about how you can implement grammar of graphics like it's implement grammar of graphics like it's implement grammar of graphics like it's it's just one approach to doing it and it's just one approach to doing it and it's just one approach to doing it and we think of course it's a valid and good we think of course it's a valid and good we think of course it's a valid and good approach but what others can have a approach but what others can have a approach but what others can have a different that use right so code at last different that use right so code at last different that use right so code at last after meet rolling on for a long time so after meet rolling on for a long time so after meet rolling on for a long time so I don't know if if any of you have I don't know if if any of you have I don't know if if any of you have managed to to find the exercise I'm managed to to find the exercise I'm managed to to find the exercise I'm knock down a file and get it open but knock down a file and get it open but knock down a file and get it open but but this is the the time where you can but this is the the time where you can but this is the the time where you can begin to - yeah this is the time where begin to - yeah this is the time where begin to - yeah this is the time where we can begin to follow along and and and we can begin to follow along and and and we can begin to follow along and and and do coding as I speak so every time we do coding as I speak so every time we do coding as I speak so every time we have a slide like the one I just showed have a slide like the one I just showed have a slide like the one I just showed you before like this you will actually you before like this you will actually you before like this you will actually have the code lets you have the code in have the code lets you have the code in have the code lets you have the code in this exercise as well and you can just this exercise as well and you can just this exercise as well and you can just execute it as we go along right and and execute it as we go along right and and execute it as we go along right and and if you don't have the code right now if you don't have the code right now if you don't have the code right now don't worry the the video will be be up don't worry the the video will be be up don't worry the the video will be be up in indefinitely and the the github in indefinitely and the the github in indefinitely and the the github repository will be there as well so you repository will be there as well so you repository will be there as well so you can just go back we rewatch and then can just go back we rewatch and then can just go back we rewatch and then just follow along and your own accord just follow along and your own accord just follow along and your own accord right okay right okay right okay so back to you okay so how do we make a so back to you okay so how do we make a so back to you okay so how do we make a club ggplot2 and we'll just we'll just club ggplot2 and we'll just we'll just club ggplot2 and we'll just we'll just take it as we go but we'll actually go take it as we go but we'll actually go take it as we go but we'll actually go through it in the same through it in the same through it in the same hmm like in the same progression that we hmm like in the same progression that we hmm like in the same progression that we just talked about like fixating on just talked about like fixating on just talked about like fixating on different parts of the grammar as we go different parts of the grammar as we go different parts of the grammar as we go along but just some some standard API along but just some some standard API along but just some some standard API things when you when we have a standard things when you when we have a standard things when you when we have a standard ggplot2 plot it will look something like ggplot2 plot it will look something like ggplot2 plot it will look something like this right we have we start with a GG this right we have we start with a GG this right we have we start with a GG plot call which defines that we are now plot call which defines that we are now plot call which defines that we are now creating a GD plot and then we define creating a GD plot and then we define creating a GD plot and then we define some data some data some data the faithful data is something that's the faithful data is something that's the faithful data is something that's built into our and it's its measurements built into our and it's its measurements built into our and it's its measurements of the length of eruption and the time of the length of eruption and the time of the length of eruption and the time between eruptions of the Old Faithful between eruptions of the Old Faithful between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone so it's just there geyser in Yellowstone so it's just there geyser in Yellowstone so it's just there and it's kind of boring but but we'll and it's kind of boring but but we'll and it's kind of boring but but we'll just use it for for show-and-tell just use it for for show-and-tell just use it for for show-and-tell so we we tell ggplot2 on the GG plot so we we tell ggplot2 on the GG plot so we we tell ggplot2 on the GG plot call what the data is and then we have call what the data is and then we have call what the data is and then we have this mapping that we talked about before this mapping that we talked about before this mapping that we talked about before and and the mapping we define with this and and the mapping we define with this and and the mapping we define with this es function yes is short for aesthetics es function yes is short for aesthetics es function yes is short for aesthetics so so everything inside the is years so so everything inside the is years so so everything inside the is years call will be mappings where we where we call will be mappings where we where we call will be mappings where we where we tell the plot well take this column from tell the plot well take this column from tell the plot well take this column from faithful and use it for X take this faithful and use it for X take this faithful and use it for X take this column from faithful and use it for y column from faithful and use it for y column from faithful and use it for y and so on and what you what you will and so on and what you what you will and so on and what you what you will probably quickly see is that we don't probably quickly see is that we don't probably quickly see is that we don't have any quotes around eruption and have any quotes around eruption and have any quotes around eruption and waiting like we don't pass it in as waiting like we don't pass it in as waiting like we don't pass it in as Springs we pass it in as these kind of Springs we pass it in as these kind of Springs we pass it in as these kind of weird language unevaluated language weird language unevaluated language weird language unevaluated language variables and if you if you're not used variables and if you if you're not used variables and if you if you're not used to both the title verse and GD plot you to both the title verse and GD plot you to both the title verse and GD plot you that might freak you out because inside that might freak you out because inside that might freak you out because inside our programming environment there's our programming environment there's our programming environment there's there's no variable called eruptions there's no variable called eruptions there's no variable called eruptions there's no variable being called mating there's no variable being called mating there's no variable being called mating but in ggplot2 these these calls x but in ggplot2 these these calls x but in ggplot2 these these calls x equals eruptions is not evaluated equals eruptions is not evaluated equals eruptions is not evaluated immediately they are they're kept for immediately they are they're kept for immediately they are they're kept for later on and then they're evaluated on later on and then they're evaluated on later on and then they're evaluated on the data so eruptions will be the column the data so eruptions will be the column the data so eruptions will be the column eruption eruption eruption in faithful and waiting will be the in faithful and waiting will be the in faithful and waiting will be the color waiting in faithful right and then color waiting in faithful right and then color waiting in faithful right and then we add at geometry dude he would just we add at geometry dude he would just we add at geometry dude he would just say geopoint how do we want to draw this say geopoint how do we want to draw this say geopoint how do we want to draw this plot and the way we added together is plot and the way we added together is plot and the way we added together is with this plus and if you use too tight with this plus and if you use too tight with this plus and if you use too tight immerse you will probably be more used immerse you will probably be more used immerse you will probably be more used to the pipe right now if you're not used to the pipe right now if you're not used to the pipe right now if you're not used to the side of us don't worry about it to the side of us don't worry about it to the side of us don't worry about it but in ggplot2 which kind of precedes but in ggplot2 which kind of precedes but in ggplot2 which kind of precedes the tie device we use the plus sign and the tie device we use the plus sign and the tie device we use the plus sign and it actually makes kind of semantic sense it actually makes kind of semantic sense it actually makes kind of semantic sense that we are adding layers to to the plot that we are adding layers to to the plot that we are adding layers to to the plot we are adding new definitions to the we are adding new definitions to the we are adding new definitions to the plot so it all makes sense and this code plot so it all makes sense and this code plot so it all makes sense and this code if you execute it in your markdown file if you execute it in your markdown file if you execute it in your markdown file will yield the the plot that we have will yield the the plot that we have will yield the the plot that we have here to the right so that's not that bad here to the right so that's not that bad here to the right so that's not that bad right kind of a bit more than if we just right kind of a bit more than if we just right kind of a bit more than if we just typed plot parentheses faithful dollar typed plot parentheses faithful dollar typed plot parentheses faithful dollar sign eruptions faithful dollar sign sign eruptions faithful dollar sign sign eruptions faithful dollar sign waiting and so on it's a bit more text waiting and so on it's a bit more text waiting and so on it's a bit more text right but it's not that bad now you may right but it's not that bad now you may right but it's not that bad now you may see it in a different way as well like see it in a different way as well like see it in a different way as well like maybe the mapping is placed inside the maybe the mapping is placed inside the maybe the mapping is placed inside the geometry geometry geometry I might trip you up and maybe even the I might trip you up and maybe even the I might trip you up and maybe even the data is also defined within the within data is also defined within the within data is also defined within the within in geometry and these all yields the in geometry and these all yields the in geometry and these all yields the same type of plot where there are slight same type of plot where there are slight same type of plot where there are slight differences to it so in the first differences to it so in the first differences to it so in the first version we set a global data that is version we set a global data that is version we set a global data that is getting inherited by all the geums getting inherited by all the geums getting inherited by all the geums and layers that we add to it and we and layers that we add to it and we and layers that we add to it and we define a global mapping that is slightly define a global mapping that is slightly define a global mapping that is slightly likewise inherited by the different likewise inherited by the different likewise inherited by the different layers afterwards whereas in this in layers afterwards whereas in this in layers afterwards whereas in this in this case we have global data but then this case we have global data but then this case we have global data but then we have a layer specific mapping so if we have a layer specific mapping so if we have a layer specific mapping so if we add a new layer to it underneath it we add a new layer to it underneath it we add a new layer to it underneath it won't inherit the mapping of taking X won't inherit the mapping of taking X won't inherit the mapping of taking X from eruption and Y from waiting and in from eruption and Y from waiting and in from eruption and Y from waiting and in this case we don't have any global data this case we don't have any global data this case we don't have any global data at all we just have data that is at all we just have data that is at all we just have data that is specific to this layer and if we add a specific to this layer and if we add a specific to this layer and if we add a new layer we have to specify some new new layer we have to specify some new new layer we have to specify some new data as well okay so if you want to end in just one last so if you want to end in just one last so if you want to end in just one last thing here I've been super nice and just thing here I've been super nice and just thing here I've been super nice and just set mappings equal and data equal and set mappings equal and data equal and set mappings equal and data equal and usually when you see ggplot2 code it's usually when you see ggplot2 code it's usually when you see ggplot2 code it's not that nice like we are so used to not that nice like we are so used to not that nice like we are so used to having the first argument of ggplot having the first argument of ggplot having the first argument of ggplot being the data and the first argument of being the data and the first argument of being the data and the first argument of of geometries being the mapping so we of geometries being the mapping so we of geometries being the mapping so we don't really type it out now that's don't really type it out now that's don't really type it out now that's probably bad practice because unless probably bad practice because unless probably bad practice because unless you're you used to do plot - it makes you're you used to do plot - it makes you're you used to do plot - it makes the the code how to read but that's just the the code how to read but that's just the the code how to read but that's just the set fact of the world we live in the set fact of the world we live in the set fact of the world we live in anyway so so this is kind of the this is anyway so so this is kind of the this is anyway so so this is kind of the this is the syntax that I'll use mainly from now the syntax that I'll use mainly from now the syntax that I'll use mainly from now on usually you have some global data for on usually you have some global data for on usually you have some global data for your plot and usually have some some your plot and usually have some some your plot and usually have some some layer specific mappings so usually when layer specific mappings so usually when layer specific mappings so usually when I write do you plot to code it will kind I write do you plot to code it will kind I write do you plot to code it will kind of like this and inside the mapping you of like this and inside the mapping you of like this and inside the mapping you can not only map positions you can also can not only map positions you can also can not only map positions you can also map all the other aesthetics that we map all the other aesthetics that we map all the other aesthetics that we talked about for instance color and here talked about for instance color and here talked about for instance color and here you kind of see one of the the great you kind of see one of the the great you kind of see one of the the great things about not passing strings into things about not passing strings into things about not passing strings into strings which are names of the of the strings which are names of the of the strings which are names of the of the columns in the data columns in the data columns in the data because for when we see with color here because for when we see with color here because for when we see with color here the mapping to color is actually an the mapping to color is actually an the mapping to color is actually an expression so we can say well the color expression so we can say well the color expression so we can say well the color should equals whether the the values in should equals whether the the values in should equals whether the the values in eruptions are smaller than three or not eruptions are smaller than three or not eruptions are smaller than three or not and it's hard to do that with if we pass and it's hard to do that with if we pass and it's hard to do that with if we pass in strings right because there is no in strings right because there is no in strings right because there is no there's no column in your data that's there's no column in your data that's there's no column in your data that's that means there's no column in data in that means there's no column in data in that means there's no column in data in the data that that is named eruptions the data that that is named eruptions the data that that is named eruptions smaller than three and if you wanted smaller than three and if you wanted smaller than three and if you wanted that you had to pre calculate it and so that you had to pre calculate it and so that you had to pre calculate it and so on and it will just kind of be more on and it will just kind of be more on and it will just kind of be more annoying to work with right so we can map colors and we can map so we can map colors and we can map so we can map colors and we can map everything inside this aesthetic Cole everything inside this aesthetic Cole everything inside this aesthetic Cole and when we do that we see that we get and when we do that we see that we get and when we do that we see that we get some extra nice things right we get some extra nice things right we get some extra nice things right we get suddenly we get a guide or a legend to suddenly we get a guide or a legend to suddenly we get a guide or a legend to the right of the plot which takes the the right of the plot which takes the the right of the plot which takes the name from from our mapping it's this name from from our mapping it's this name from from our mapping it's this eruption smaller than three and then it eruption smaller than three and then it eruption smaller than three and then it says well if it's red it's false if it's says well if it's red it's false if it's says well if it's red it's false if it's bluish it's true right bluish it's true right bluish it's true right it doesn't really surprises us but but it doesn't really surprises us but but it doesn't really surprises us but but it gives us all these things for free it gives us all these things for free it gives us all these things for free which is super nice because creating which is super nice because creating which is super nice because creating legends and so on should just it should legends and so on should just it should legends and so on should just it should be as absolutely easy as possible be as absolutely easy as possible be as absolutely easy as possible because legends guys axes are because legends guys axes are because legends guys axes are instrumental to actually understanding instrumental to actually understanding instrumental to actually understanding the plot like if there weren't any the plot like if there weren't any the plot like if there weren't any legend here you would have no clue what legend here you would have no clue what legend here you would have no clue what the color meant well maybe you could the color meant well maybe you could the color meant well maybe you could deduce it in this symbol the symbol deduce it in this symbol the symbol deduce it in this symbol the symbol example but but generally when you do example but but generally when you do example but but generally when you do some sort of mapping from data to to some sort of mapping from data to to some sort of mapping from data to to aesthetics you have to give the use of aesthetics you have to give the use of aesthetics you have to give the use of some way of mapping it back in the head some way of mapping it back in the head some way of mapping it back in the head like how can i how can i interpret this like how can i how can i interpret this like how can i how can i interpret this graphical properties okay now you can do graphical properties okay now you can do graphical properties okay now you can do something else with color which is that something else with color which is that something else with color which is that instead of mapping it you can set it and instead of mapping it you can set it and instead of mapping it you can set it and here we're setting it to steel-blue here we're setting it to steel-blue here we're setting it to steel-blue which is just a color and what we see is which is just a color and what we see is which is just a color and what we see is that we have it outside of our aesthetic that we have it outside of our aesthetic that we have it outside of our aesthetic call and steel blue is now a string call and steel blue is now a string call and steel blue is now a string giving a color name and what we see now giving a color name and what we see now giving a color name and what we see now is that there is no legend because there is that there is no legend because there is that there is no legend because there is no mapping there is just all the is no mapping there is just all the is no mapping there is just all the points have a specific color and and points have a specific color and and points have a specific color and and when we do that we kind of say well I when we do that we kind of say well I when we do that we kind of say well I want the colors to be blue not because want the colors to be blue not because want the colors to be blue not because the data dictates it but just kind of the data dictates it but just kind of the data dictates it but just kind of like them blue it fits well within the like them blue it fits well within the like them blue it fits well within the theme of my my plot or whatever let them theme of my my plot or whatever let them theme of my my plot or whatever let them just be blue right so there's no legend just be blue right so there's no legend just be blue right so there's no legend because it doesn't mean anything they because it doesn't mean anything they because it doesn't mean anything they could just as well be black as an could just as well be black as an could just as well be black as an aesthetic choice okay and this actually aesthetic choice okay and this actually aesthetic choice okay and this actually gets into maybe one of the biggest gets into maybe one of the biggest gets into maybe one of the biggest confusions that I have seen on the confusions that I have seen on the confusions that I have seen on the internet when people get started with internet when people get started with internet when people get started with with ggplot2 and let's just for losing with ggplot2 and let's just for losing with ggplot2 and let's just for losing my virginity for live coding on the my virginity for live coding on the my virginity for live coding on the internet let's just get down to this internet let's just get down to this internet let's just get down to this example like here okay so this is the example like here okay so this is the example like here okay so this is the this is the plot that we saw before this is the plot that we saw before this is the plot that we saw before right now what happens if we take this right now what happens if we take this right now what happens if we take this statement oops statement oops statement oops and put it inside aesthetics you might and put it inside aesthetics you might and put it inside aesthetics you might be surprised maybe you've seen this be surprised maybe you've seen this be surprised maybe you've seen this before but you might be surprised I this before but you might be surprised I this before but you might be surprised I this is a stupid plot right we just said that is a stupid plot right we just said that is a stupid plot right we just said that the color should be still blue and the color should be still blue and the color should be still blue and they're red and also we have this like they're red and also we have this like they're red and also we have this like weird nonsensical Legend over here like weird nonsensical Legend over here like weird nonsensical Legend over here like what what is all this about and well what what is all this about and well what what is all this about and well it's kind of your own fault you're using it's kind of your own fault you're using it's kind of your own fault you're using it wrong right but but but there's it wrong right but but but there's it wrong right but but but there's actually a sense to it so the thing actually a sense to it so the thing actually a sense to it so the thing that's happening is that we're doing that's happening is that we're doing that's happening is that we're doing mapping because we're doing it inside mapping because we're doing it inside mapping because we're doing it inside yes here right so so this is a mapping yes here right so so this is a mapping yes here right so so this is a mapping and we are mapping the expression and we are mapping the expression and we are mapping the expression expression steel-blue expression steel-blue expression steel-blue to color so we're saying that color to color so we're saying that color to color so we're saying that color should be taken from the variable not should be taken from the variable not should be taken from the variable not the variable steal boob just like like a the variable steal boob just like like a the variable steal boob just like like a fixed value called steel blue and steel fixed value called steel blue and steel fixed value called steel blue and steel blue will then be expanded to like it blue will then be expanded to like it blue will then be expanded to like it will be recycled so every every row in will be recycled so every every row in will be recycled so every every row in our dataset will get the same steel blue our dataset will get the same steel blue our dataset will get the same steel blue variable value and that variable will variable value and that variable will variable value and that variable will then be passed into the scale and it then be passed into the scale and it then be passed into the scale and it will say well we have something called will say well we have something called will say well we have something called steel blue let's map that to red and it steel blue let's map that to red and it steel blue let's map that to red and it will color everything red and it will will color everything red and it will will color everything red and it will give you a nice legend telling you that give you a nice legend telling you that give you a nice legend telling you that well if it's red is because it has the well if it's red is because it has the well if it's red is because it has the value still blue so so this is this is value still blue so so this is this is value still blue so so this is this is something that church people level up a something that church people level up a something that church people level up a lot and the thing that you should simply lot and the thing that you should simply lot and the thing that you should simply just remember is that if you want to just remember is that if you want to just remember is that if you want to take something from the data you put it take something from the data you put it take something from the data you put it inside these if you want to simply just inside these if you want to simply just inside these if you want to simply just set a thing like I want to define that set a thing like I want to define that set a thing like I want to define that the size of the points be equal to two the size of the points be equal to two the size of the points be equal to two centimeters or whatever you set it and centimeters or whatever you set it and centimeters or whatever you set it and you put it outside of our study so if you put it outside of our study so if you put it outside of our study so if you just learn this you just learn this you just learn this during these this webinar I think I've during these this webinar I think I've during these this webinar I think I've kind of succeeded and and improved the kind of succeeded and and improved the kind of succeeded and and improved the world of it and everything is back to as world of it and everything is back to as world of it and everything is back to as it should be ok let's get back to the it should be ok let's get back to the it should be ok let's get back to the slice so sitting colors as opposed to slice so sitting colors as opposed to slice so sitting colors as opposed to mapping mapping colors now points are mapping mapping colors now points are mapping mapping colors now points are not the only only geometry as we talked not the only only geometry as we talked not the only only geometry as we talked about there's a lot of different about there's a lot of different about there's a lot of different geometries and not all geometries have geometries and not all geometries have geometries and not all geometries have the same mapping requirements so for the same mapping requirements so for the same mapping requirements so for instance you cannot really have a have a instance you cannot really have a have a instance you cannot really have a have a point geometry without both mapping x point geometry without both mapping x point geometry without both mapping x and y because we need both these and y because we need both these and y because we need both these positional aesthetics to figure out positional aesthetics to figure out positional aesthetics to figure out where to put the points but for instance where to put the points but for instance where to put the points but for instance if we have a GM histogram we only need a if we have a GM histogram we only need a if we have a GM histogram we only need a single X mapping and that's because that single X mapping and that's because that single X mapping and that's because that Jim histogram will calculate the Y by Jim histogram will calculate the Y by Jim histogram will calculate the Y by itself simply by saying well I have this itself simply by saying well I have this itself simply by saying well I have this continuous variable called eruption and continuous variable called eruption and continuous variable called eruption and I'll cut it up in bins and I'll just I'll cut it up in bins and I'll just I'll cut it up in bins and I'll just simply count how many things that are simply count how many things that are simply count how many things that are inside the spins and if you just think I inside the spins and if you just think I inside the spins and if you just think I had a bit then yes this is a statistics had a bit then yes this is a statistics had a bit then yes this is a statistics that's doing all that so so mapping that's doing all that so so mapping that's doing all that so so mapping requirements differ obviously and you requirements differ obviously and you requirements differ obviously and you have to look into the different help have to look into the different help have to look into the different help [Music] [Music] [Music] sorry you have to look into the sorry you have to look into the sorry you have to look into the different help documentation for that different help documentation for that different help documentation for that let's just hop over here and and look at let's just hop over here and and look at let's just hop over here and and look at some help some help some help ok so for instance gee it's the ground ok so for instance gee it's the ground ok so for instance gee it's the ground so if you're not familiar with our so if you're not familiar with our so if you're not familiar with our syntax we just have this question sign syntax we just have this question sign syntax we just have this question sign in front of it and then just the name of in front of it and then just the name of in front of it and then just the name of the function and we get the help the the function and we get the help the the function and we get the help the help entry over here and and if you help entry over here and and if you help entry over here and and if you figure wondering what kind of of figure wondering what kind of of figure wondering what kind of of different aesthetics a specific geometry different aesthetics a specific geometry different aesthetics a specific geometry you can can understand we can just you can can understand we can just you can can understand we can just scroll way down way down scroll way down way down scroll way down way down down this is Oh probably why a lot of down this is Oh probably why a lot of down this is Oh probably why a lot of people miss it people miss it people miss it [Music] [Music] [Music] so aesthetics over here that's actually so aesthetics over here that's actually so aesthetics over here that's actually a bad example but anyway Jim histogram a bad example but anyway Jim histogram a bad example but anyway Jim histogram uses the same aesthetic as Jim bar so uses the same aesthetic as Jim bar so uses the same aesthetic as Jim bar so let's just look at that because that's let's just look at that because that's let's just look at that because that's more representative so we scroll way more representative so we scroll way more representative so we scroll way down and we have a steady snow so most down and we have a steady snow so most down and we have a steady snow so most of the the geometries have this section of the the geometries have this section of the the geometries have this section called aesthetics and it will say well called aesthetics and it will say well called aesthetics and it will say well jumpa understands these different jumpa understands these different jumpa understands these different aesthetics and if it's in bold it's aesthetics and if it's in bold it's aesthetics and if it's in bold it's required you have to do something with required you have to do something with required you have to do something with it right you have to you have to provide it right you have to you have to provide it right you have to you have to provide something that's X&amp;Y for Jimba and something that's X&amp;Y for Jimba and something that's X&amp;Y for Jimba and there's alpha and color and fill and all there's alpha and color and fill and all there's alpha and color and fill and all these but these are not required okay so these but these are not required okay so these but these are not required okay so so different layers have different so different layers have different so different layers have different requirements and different knowledge of requirements and different knowledge of requirements and different knowledge of different aesthetics and so on right yep different aesthetics and so on right yep different aesthetics and so on right yep let's just reset that to this and jump let's just reset that to this and jump let's just reset that to this and jump back since last okay and as we briefly back since last okay and as we briefly back since last okay and as we briefly touched upon before your plot is not touched upon before your plot is not touched upon before your plot is not confined to a single geometry or a confined to a single geometry or a confined to a single geometry or a single layer for instance here we have single layer for instance here we have single layer for instance here we have two layers we have a density in 2d two layers we have a density in 2d two layers we have a density in 2d density layer that's shown us as density layer that's shown us as density layer that's shown us as contours and then we have a point layer contours and then we have a point layer contours and then we have a point layer and and here is where the plus sign and and here is where the plus sign and and here is where the plus sign looses its its mathematical meaning looses its its mathematical meaning looses its its mathematical meaning because the order of arguments within because the order of arguments within because the order of arguments within the plus sign matters like the first the plus sign matters like the first the plus sign matters like the first thing the first layer that you add will thing the first layer that you add will thing the first layer that you add will will be below the second layer that you will be below the second layer that you will be below the second layer that you add so if you look at this if you look add so if you look at this if you look add so if you look at this if you look at this plot over here we can see or at this plot over here we can see or at this plot over here we can see or maybe it's a bit hard to see but the maybe it's a bit hard to see but the maybe it's a bit hard to see but the point is actually on top of the blue point is actually on top of the blue point is actually on top of the blue lines so the order of the addition of lines so the order of the addition of lines so the order of the addition of layers defines the order of the layers layers defines the order of the layers layers defines the order of the layers in your club okay now that was a that in your club okay now that was a that in your club okay now that was a that was not so hard right like we talked was not so hard right like we talked was not so hard right like we talked about all these different things and about all these different things and about all these different things and then in the end all we needed was to then in the end all we needed was to then in the end all we needed was to have some data define some mapping and have some data define some mapping and have some data define some mapping and define some geometries define some geometries define some geometries so even though that we have all these so even though that we have all these so even though that we have all these different theoretical punch drugs we different theoretical punch drugs we different theoretical punch drugs we don't need to apply them to each and don't need to apply them to each and don't need to apply them to each and every plot that we make and the reason every plot that we make and the reason every plot that we make and the reason for that is that well everything else for that is that well everything else for that is that well everything else has some some quite sensible defaults has some some quite sensible defaults has some some quite sensible defaults not always beautiful defaults but they not always beautiful defaults but they not always beautiful defaults but they are sensible in the sense that they are are sensible in the sense that they are are sensible in the sense that they are understandable and so on so of course we understandable and so on so of course we understandable and so on so of course we have all the other things and we can use have all the other things and we can use have all the other things and we can use that to to further control how the how that to to further control how the how that to to further control how the how how we draw things and and how the the how we draw things and and how the the how we draw things and and how the the end result ends up looking and we'll go end result ends up looking and we'll go end result ends up looking and we'll go through them now right so let's focus on through them now right so let's focus on through them now right so let's focus on statistics and if you are confused about statistics and if you are confused about statistics and if you are confused about statistics you're not the only one I a statistics you're not the only one I a statistics you're not the only one I a month two ago I did a I did a question month two ago I did a I did a question month two ago I did a I did a question on Twitter foolishly I asked Twitter if on Twitter foolishly I asked Twitter if on Twitter foolishly I asked Twitter if they were if there is a seasoned ggplot2 they were if there is a seasoned ggplot2 they were if there is a seasoned ggplot2 user what were the most confusing part user what were the most confusing part user what were the most confusing part of it and one of them was sizing like of it and one of them was sizing like of it and one of them was sizing like how do I ensure that the text is the how do I ensure that the text is the how do I ensure that the text is the right size when I exported and the other right size when I exported and the other right size when I exported and the other thing was what is statistics like I've thing was what is statistics like I've thing was what is statistics like I've never learned it and I think I think one never learned it and I think I think one never learned it and I think I think one of the reasons why it's it's so of the reasons why it's it's so of the reasons why it's it's so confusing is that the statistics and confusing is that the statistics and confusing is that the statistics and geometries are kind of linked together geometries are kind of linked together geometries are kind of linked together and and those two together kind of and and those two together kind of and and those two together kind of defines a layer and every geom has a defines a layer and every geom has a defines a layer and every geom has a default statistics as far as that as default statistics as far as that as default statistics as far as that as it's called in GD plot to a lot of times it's called in GD plot to a lot of times it's called in GD plot to a lot of times it's that identity which means just it's that identity which means just it's that identity which means just don't do anything just pass it on but don't do anything just pass it on but don't do anything just pass it on but for instance GM boxplot has a step back for instance GM boxplot has a step back for instance GM boxplot has a step back + and they're kind of linked together so + and they're kind of linked together so + and they're kind of linked together so so usually don't really think about the so usually don't really think about the so usually don't really think about the statistics because the the community is statistics because the the community is statistics because the the community is kind of coalesced around adding GM to kind of coalesced around adding GM to kind of coalesced around adding GM to the when defining layers instead of the when defining layers instead of the when defining layers instead of adding stats so so when you look at code adding stats so so when you look at code adding stats so so when you look at code you have all these geometries and you have all these geometries and you have all these geometries and sometimes there's statistics or a stat sometimes there's statistics or a stat sometimes there's statistics or a stat call cropping oven when what the hell is call cropping oven when what the hell is call cropping oven when what the hell is that but but basically as we talked that but but basically as we talked that but but basically as we talked about the statistics are really just about the statistics are really just about the statistics are really just there to to ensure that you don't have there to to ensure that you don't have there to to ensure that you don't have to pre calculate all the values to the to pre calculate all the values to the to pre calculate all the values to the work that you want to plot and sometimes work that you want to plot and sometimes work that you want to plot and sometimes they're required like sometimes you have they're required like sometimes you have they're required like sometimes you have to apply some sort of statistics because to apply some sort of statistics because to apply some sort of statistics because you will like you will never pass in pre you will like you will never pass in pre you will like you will never pass in pre calculated data for boxplot for instance calculated data for boxplot for instance calculated data for boxplot for instance but other times that then you can but other times that then you can but other times that then you can actually like make a choice and say well actually like make a choice and say well actually like make a choice and say well I have pre calculated data so I don't I have pre calculated data so I don't I have pre calculated data so I don't want to apply the statistics so I want to apply the statistics so I want to apply the statistics so I overwrite the default autistics don't overwrite the default autistics don't overwrite the default autistics don't worry we'll get into it oh hey I lost worry we'll get into it oh hey I lost worry we'll get into it oh hey I lost track of myself I forgot the exercises track of myself I forgot the exercises track of myself I forgot the exercises let's just ignore what I've talked about let's just ignore what I've talked about let's just ignore what I've talked about in statistics and just quickly jump over in statistics and just quickly jump over in statistics and just quickly jump over to some exercises because that's what to some exercises because that's what to some exercises because that's what it's all about right you want to see me it's all about right you want to see me it's all about right you want to see me live code and you want to see me screw live code and you want to see me screw live code and you want to see me screw up everything because like I wrote these up everything because like I wrote these up everything because like I wrote these two exercises months ago so I've long two exercises months ago so I've long two exercises months ago so I've long since forgotten what I actually had in since forgotten what I actually had in since forgotten what I actually had in mind when I wrote them so so I will mind when I wrote them so so I will mind when I wrote them so so I will potentially mess up and that's that's potentially mess up and that's that's potentially mess up and that's that's good because that means that we can all good because that means that we can all good because that means that we can all learn from it right so one of the learn from it right so one of the learn from it right so one of the exercises modified the code below to exercises modified the code below to exercises modified the code below to make the points larger squares and make the points larger squares and make the points larger squares and slightly transparent and then we see CGM slightly transparent and then we see CGM slightly transparent and then we see CGM point for more information about the point for more information about the point for more information about the point layer this was what we just did point layer this was what we just did point layer this was what we just did with with geom histogram and jimba so we with with geom histogram and jimba so we with with geom histogram and jimba so we already have a plot here and and it's it already have a plot here and and it's it already have a plot here and and it's it says we've seen before and it asks us to says we've seen before and it asks us to says we've seen before and it asks us to to make the points large squares and to make the points large squares and to make the points large squares and slightly transparent now since all of slightly transparent now since all of slightly transparent now since all of them should just be squares and all of them should just be squares and all of them should just be squares and all of them should just be transparent them should just be transparent them should just be transparent [Music] [Music] [Music] we're not grabbing anything from the we're not grabbing anything from the we're not grabbing anything from the data which means that we are sitting data which means that we are sitting data which means that we are sitting aesthetics rather than mapping it aesthetics rather than mapping it aesthetics rather than mapping it so what we can do is that we can say so what we can do is that we can say so what we can do is that we can say well this shape aesthetic which defines well this shape aesthetic which defines well this shape aesthetic which defines the shape of the points we will set that the shape of the points we will set that the shape of the points we will set that to where let's see if that works to where let's see if that works to where let's see if that works oh and behold it is now square now what oh and behold it is now square now what oh and behold it is now square now what would have happened if we did this would that make sense not at all would that make sense not at all would that make sense not at all we run into exactly the same thing as we we run into exactly the same thing as we we run into exactly the same thing as we did with the colors right so we want to did with the colors right so we want to did with the colors right so we want to set it instead of mapping it right and set it instead of mapping it right and set it instead of mapping it right and we also want them to be slightly we also want them to be slightly we also want them to be slightly transparent like so to understand that transparent like so to understand that transparent like so to understand that or to figure that out you have to or to figure that out you have to or to figure that out you have to understand that transparency is understand that transparency is understand that transparency is controlled through an aesthetic called controlled through an aesthetic called controlled through an aesthetic called alpha and that may not mean a lot to you alpha and that may not mean a lot to you alpha and that may not mean a lot to you if you're not if you're not well versed if you're not if you're not well versed if you're not if you're not well versed in in color encoding and so on but but in in color encoding and so on but but in in color encoding and so on but but alpha is simply like a name that we alpha is simply like a name that we alpha is simply like a name that we often use for transparency and alpha can often use for transparency and alpha can often use for transparency and alpha can vary between 0 &amp; 1 1 being completely vary between 0 &amp; 1 1 being completely vary between 0 &amp; 1 1 being completely opaque and 0 being fully transparent opaque and 0 being fully transparent opaque and 0 being fully transparent meaning invisible and we should make it meaning invisible and we should make it meaning invisible and we should make it slightly transparent so let's say we do slightly transparent so let's say we do slightly transparent so let's say we do alpha equals 0.3 and there we go we have alpha equals 0.3 and there we go we have alpha equals 0.3 and there we go we have we have achieved transparency in our we have achieved transparency in our we have achieved transparency in our squares right then we have another plot squares right then we have another plot squares right then we have another plot down here which is a histogram as we saw down here which is a histogram as we saw down here which is a histogram as we saw before and now it says color the two before and now it says color the two before and now it says color the two distribution in the histogram with distribution in the histogram with distribution in the histogram with different colors and it alludes to that different colors and it alludes to that different colors and it alludes to that we have like two different distributions we have like two different distributions we have like two different distributions here and we want to give it different here and we want to give it different here and we want to give it different colors now we might want to do something colors now we might want to do something colors now we might want to do something like colors equals eruptions let's say like colors equals eruptions let's say like colors equals eruptions let's say eruptions is below 3.1 maybe three point one and you will be three point one and you will be three point one and you will be surprised by the result because this was surprised by the result because this was surprised by the result because this was not what we set out to be right we why not what we set out to be right we why not what we set out to be right we why is that well in ggplot2 land we have two is that well in ggplot2 land we have two is that well in ggplot2 land we have two different color related aesthetics we different color related aesthetics we different color related aesthetics we have one called color and we have one have one called color and we have one have one called color and we have one called film and for four things with called film and for four things with called film and for four things with Phil then the fill is that it defines Phil then the fill is that it defines Phil then the fill is that it defines the color of the interior and the colors the color of the interior and the colors the color of the interior and the colors that it defines the color of the stroke that it defines the color of the stroke that it defines the color of the stroke and does that make sense well maybe but and does that make sense well maybe but and does that make sense well maybe but that's just kind of a convention you that's just kind of a convention you that's just kind of a convention you have to learn it so we don't want to set have to learn it so we don't want to set have to learn it so we don't want to set the color steady here even though we the color steady here even though we the color steady here even though we want to color it we want to set the want to color it we want to set the want to color it we want to set the field study here and there you go we field study here and there you go we field study here and there you go we have achieved what we set out to do okay have achieved what we set out to do okay have achieved what we set out to do okay and what do we have here color the and what do we have here color the and what do we have here color the distribution in the histogram by where distribution in the histogram by where distribution in the histogram by where the weighting is above a below 60 so the weighting is above a below 60 so the weighting is above a below 60 so suddenly now we're not coloring the fill suddenly now we're not coloring the fill suddenly now we're not coloring the fill based on what we already have here the based on what we already have here the based on what we already have here the mapping we already have here with wick mapping we already have here with wick mapping we already have here with wick coloring by something else so let's say coloring by something else so let's say coloring by something else so let's say equals 60 and what happens here now it equals 60 and what happens here now it equals 60 and what happens here now it actually does the right thing right it actually does the right thing right it actually does the right thing right it goes differently but what is what do we goes differently but what is what do we goes differently but what is what do we see especially on the left it can be see especially on the left it can be see especially on the left it can be kind of hard to say to see right here kind of hard to say to see right here kind of hard to say to see right here are they stacked together are they are are they stacked together are they are are they stacked together are they are they in front of or behind each other they in front of or behind each other they in front of or behind each other what's actually going on and and if they what's actually going on and and if they what's actually going on and and if they are stacked together like how can it are stacked together like how can it are stacked together like how can it even figure that out and what what's even figure that out and what what's even figure that out and what what's really happening here is that something really happening here is that something really happening here is that something that we haven't really talked about at that we haven't really talked about at that we haven't really talked about at all and I don't want to talk too much all and I don't want to talk too much all and I don't want to talk too much about it about it about it it's the dares for each layer there's it's the dares for each layer there's it's the dares for each layer there's also a position adjustment and the also a position adjustment and the also a position adjustment and the position adjustment can actually say position adjustment can actually say position adjustment can actually say well after we have scaled everything well after we have scaled everything well after we have scaled everything reposition something in the plot and for reposition something in the plot and for reposition something in the plot and for atiim histogram the the default is the atiim histogram the the default is the atiim histogram the the default is the the stack position which is position the stack position which is position the stack position which is position equals stack now if we change that to equals stack now if we change that to equals stack now if we change that to say position equals identity I didn't say position equals identity I didn't say position equals identity I didn't see what would happen no there was I was for a minute surprise no there was I was for a minute surprise no there was I was for a minute surprise okay let's see well we get a different okay let's see well we get a different okay let's see well we get a different plot right what's happening suddenly we plot right what's happening suddenly we plot right what's happening suddenly we can see the rest way anymore and and the can see the rest way anymore and and the can see the rest way anymore and and the reason for that is actually that they reason for that is actually that they reason for that is actually that they are behind and and how we can say you are behind and and how we can say you are behind and and how we can say you see that is that we can I can see that see that is that we can I can see that see that is that we can I can see that you kind of see one typing if we set you kind of see one typing if we set you kind of see one typing if we set make the bars a bit transparent we can make the bars a bit transparent we can make the bars a bit transparent we can see that they're actually hiding behind see that they're actually hiding behind see that they're actually hiding behind them so it's like it's a sensible them so it's like it's a sensible them so it's like it's a sensible default to have them stacked instead so default to have them stacked instead so default to have them stacked instead so we can actually see the different values we can actually see the different values we can actually see the different values but there's no magic going on it's just but there's no magic going on it's just but there's no magic going on it's just figuring out that well we have two figuring out that well we have two figuring out that well we have two different bars at the same value because different bars at the same value because different bars at the same value because they have two different fields that's they have two different fields that's they have two different fields that's just putting them on top of each other just putting them on top of each other just putting them on top of each other there are other types of positions there are other types of positions there are other types of positions adjustments where you have Dutch for adjustments where you have Dutch for adjustments where you have Dutch for instance which puts them side-by-side to instance which puts them side-by-side to instance which puts them side-by-side to each other instead that might be better each other instead that might be better each other instead that might be better at least it's it's clear that they're at least it's it's clear that they're at least it's it's clear that they're not behind each other there's a kind of not behind each other there's a kind of not behind each other there's a kind of a that can be confusion when it comes to a that can be confusion when it comes to a that can be confusion when it comes to stacked bar charts because only behind stacked bar charts because only behind stacked bar charts because only behind each other or are they stacked we can't each other or are they stacked we can't each other or are they stacked we can't really see that we can see it when we really see that we can see it when we really see that we can see it when we touch them like this but it's kind of a touch them like this but it's kind of a touch them like this but it's kind of a knocking play anyway okay so last little knocking play anyway okay so last little knocking play anyway okay so last little bit of exercise for now add a line that bit of exercise for now add a line that bit of exercise for now add a line that separates the two separates the two separates the two distribution and we're told that we can distribution and we're told that we can distribution and we're told that we can look into a plan for how to draw look into a plan for how to draw look into a plan for how to draw straight lines from a slope and an straight lines from a slope and an straight lines from a slope and an intercept so let's try that we'll add a intercept so let's try that we'll add a intercept so let's try that we'll add a new layer and we are using to map a new layer and we are using to map a new layer and we are using to map a beeline to do that and I'll have to do beeline to do that and I'll have to do beeline to do that and I'll have to do some spitballing here right so what's some spitballing here right so what's some spitballing here right so what's what's the slope going to be like from what's the slope going to be like from what's the slope going to be like from here to here I would say any good guess here to here I would say any good guess here to here I would say any good guess is 40 minus 40 is 40 minus 40 is 40 minus 40 probably slope equals minus 4 y probably slope equals minus 4 y probably slope equals minus 4 y intercepts pretty high 150 maybe let's intercepts pretty high 150 maybe let's intercepts pretty high 150 maybe let's see ah slope is okay um intercepts see ah slope is okay um intercepts see ah slope is okay um intercepts should be definitely higher oh that's should be definitely higher oh that's should be definitely higher oh that's too much let's put it in the middle 200 too much let's put it in the middle 200 too much let's put it in the middle 200 no that's good enough anyway so as we no that's good enough anyway so as we no that's good enough anyway so as we can see we can gradually build up our can see we can gradually build up our can see we can gradually build up our plot by simply saying well we have this plot by simply saying well we have this plot by simply saying well we have this point layer and I actually want to add a point layer and I actually want to add a point layer and I actually want to add a line suit well we'll just add a new line suit well we'll just add a new line suit well we'll just add a new layer to it and that's just that and we layer to it and that's just that and we layer to it and that's just that and we can just gradually build up our plus can just gradually build up our plus can just gradually build up our plus with layers and layers and layers and with layers and layers and layers and with layers and layers and layers and layers all maybe not that many leaves layers all maybe not that many leaves layers all maybe not that many leaves but a fair amount of layers at least but a fair amount of layers at least but a fair amount of layers at least okay okay okay all the exercise is done for now we'll all the exercise is done for now we'll all the exercise is done for now we'll get back here get back here get back here okay sorry about messing up the okay sorry about messing up the okay sorry about messing up the progression of the slides anyway back to progression of the slides anyway back to progression of the slides anyway back to statistics as we talked about they had statistics as we talked about they had statistics as we talked about they had to understand and mainly hard to to understand and mainly hard to to understand and mainly hard to understand because usually people don't understand because usually people don't understand because usually people don't look at them they are kind of set look at them they are kind of set look at them they are kind of set default for GMS geometries and people default for GMS geometries and people default for GMS geometries and people are usually thinking in geometries it's are usually thinking in geometries it's are usually thinking in geometries it's it's most often easier to to think about it's most often easier to to think about it's most often easier to to think about well I want to add some bass to my Plus well I want to add some bass to my Plus well I want to add some bass to my Plus rather than I want to calculate some rather than I want to calculate some rather than I want to calculate some counts to my plot and then visualize the counts to my plot and then visualize the counts to my plot and then visualize the moon with bass so for most people that moon with bass so for most people that moon with bass so for most people that the geometries come first in the the geometries come first in the the geometries come first in the statistics is kind of an statistics is kind of an statistics is kind of an - thought especially because a lot of - thought especially because a lot of - thought especially because a lot of the times they they have a sensible the times they they have a sensible the times they they have a sensible default right so every time they default right so every time they default right so every time they actually do crap up people get kind of actually do crap up people get kind of actually do crap up people get kind of confused because they're not used to confused because they're not used to confused because they're not used to seeing them so if you have ever felt seeing them so if you have ever felt seeing them so if you have ever felt confused about statistics don't feel bad confused about statistics don't feel bad confused about statistics don't feel bad everyone has that okay so we just have everyone has that okay so we just have everyone has that okay so we just have this plot you plot MPE we have a new this plot you plot MPE we have a new this plot you plot MPE we have a new data set now which is just different data set now which is just different data set now which is just different different car types from different years different car types from different years different car types from different years and so on and we we're going to make a and so on and we we're going to make a and so on and we we're going to make a power plot where where we count them by power plot where where we count them by power plot where where we count them by class we can see it just happens class we can see it just happens class we can see it just happens automatically so so the MPG data set if automatically so so the MPG data set if automatically so so the MPG data set if we look at it it just has a row for for we look at it it just has a row for for we look at it it just has a row for for each car and if we'd say Jimba and maps each car and if we'd say Jimba and maps each car and if we'd say Jimba and maps x2 class it will figure out that well x2 class it will figure out that well x2 class it will figure out that well there are so many there are so many rows there are so many there are so many rows there are so many there are so many rows that has the same X and let's just count that has the same X and let's just count that has the same X and let's just count them up and then use that to Y them up and then use that to Y them up and then use that to Y formatting the y formatting the y formatting the y that's because Jimba uses that count by that's because Jimba uses that count by that's because Jimba uses that count by default now sometimes we have pre default now sometimes we have pre default now sometimes we have pre computed data especially if if we have computed data especially if if we have computed data especially if if we have like humongous data like if we're like humongous data like if we're like humongous data like if we're talking about billions and billions of talking about billions and billions of talking about billions and billions of rows for instance well it's not really rows for instance well it's not really rows for instance well it's not really feasible to have all that in your feasible to have all that in your feasible to have all that in your computer just for the sake of plotting computer just for the sake of plotting computer just for the sake of plotting about what right so mater so oftentimes about what right so mater so oftentimes about what right so mater so oftentimes you will simply ask your your database you will simply ask your your database you will simply ask your your database give me a count of this and get a much give me a count of this and get a much give me a count of this and get a much smaller data set back right but now smaller data set back right but now smaller data set back right but now suddenly you don't have the data that is suddenly you don't have the data that is suddenly you don't have the data that is in the format that is expected for for in the format that is expected for for in the format that is expected for for JimBob so what can you do well you can JimBob so what can you do well you can JimBob so what can you do well you can say well I don't want this count say well I don't want this count say well I don't want this count statistics instead I already have my statistics instead I already have my statistics instead I already have my calculated count so don't do anything calculated count so don't do anything calculated count so don't do anything don't do anything so just use this don't do anything so just use this don't do anything so just use this identity stat which is just passing the identity stat which is just passing the identity stat which is just passing the data along but now suddenly if you data along but now suddenly if you data along but now suddenly if you get the code before we only had to map X get the code before we only had to map X get the code before we only had to map X to class suddenly now we have to map Y to class suddenly now we have to map Y to class suddenly now we have to map Y as well to the count that we that we as well to the count that we that we as well to the count that we that we already have in our data right so if you already have in our data right so if you already have in our data right so if you have pre computed data that conforms to have pre computed data that conforms to have pre computed data that conforms to the requirement of the geometry you can the requirement of the geometry you can the requirement of the geometry you can just set the stat to identity and and just set the stat to identity and and just set the stat to identity and and just pass that data along now usually just pass that data along now usually just pass that data along now usually you actually don't need to do this this you actually don't need to do this this you actually don't need to do this this is something a lot of people who need to is something a lot of people who need to is something a lot of people who need to do like a few bar with with pre computed do like a few bar with with pre computed do like a few bar with with pre computed data and that is why we already have a data and that is why we already have a data and that is why we already have a deal which is Beaufort which is called deal which is Beaufort which is called deal which is Beaufort which is called Jim Cole and this is simply just jump a Jim Cole and this is simply just jump a Jim Cole and this is simply just jump a more-or-less with with the with the stat more-or-less with with the with the stat more-or-less with with the with the stat stat to identity instead and this is stat to identity instead and this is stat to identity instead and this is this is generally true actually for this is generally true actually for this is generally true actually for ggplot2 which also works badly for ggplot2 which also works badly for ggplot2 which also works badly for understanding upstairs the idea that we understanding upstairs the idea that we understanding upstairs the idea that we have we have geometries as the have we have geometries as the have we have geometries as the first-class citizen and statistics as first-class citizen and statistics as first-class citizen and statistics as kind of a second class citizen means kind of a second class citizen means kind of a second class citizen means that for every or for most meaningful that for every or for most meaningful that for every or for most meaningful combination of of geometry and stat we combination of of geometry and stat we combination of of geometry and stat we will have a team construction like for will have a team construction like for will have a team construction like for instance with Jim Cole which is you instance with Jim Cole which is you instance with Jim Cole which is you could say well why do why we have Jim could say well why do why we have Jim could say well why do why we have Jim Cole you can just have a jump and says Cole you can just have a jump and says Cole you can just have a jump and says that to a tenancy that to a tenancy that to a tenancy well it's getting used enough that that well it's getting used enough that that well it's getting used enough that that it makes sense to have a shortcut for it it makes sense to have a shortcut for it it makes sense to have a shortcut for it and and this is in general how we and and this is in general how we and and this is in general how we approach it so so if there's a approach it so so if there's a approach it so so if there's a combination that is it's generally combination that is it's generally combination that is it's generally usable for a lot of people you will usable for a lot of people you will usable for a lot of people you will usually see that we have a shortcut usually see that we have a shortcut usually see that we have a shortcut constructor for it and you don't have to constructor for it and you don't have to constructor for it and you don't have to think about stats once again now the think about stats once again now the think about stats once again now the stat is doing stuff obviously it is stat is doing stuff obviously it is stat is doing stuff obviously it is calculating new values under the hood calculating new values under the hood calculating new values under the hood for instance account now what if you for instance account now what if you for instance account now what if you wanted to do something with that what wanted to do something with that what wanted to do something with that what what if you wanted to do something with what if you wanted to do something with what if you wanted to do something with the values that comes out of the staff the values that comes out of the staff the values that comes out of the staff well if you're an old-time did you plot well if you're an old-time did you plot well if you're an old-time did you plot to user you might you might know that to user you might you might know that to user you might you might know that there is a stat function stat there is a stat function stat there is a stat function stat parentheses for accessing these values parentheses for accessing these values parentheses for accessing these values if you're even older ggplot2 user you if you're even older ggplot2 user you if you're even older ggplot2 user you may remember the the weird dot variable may remember the the weird dot variable may remember the the weird dot variable name dot dot notation I'm not going to name dot dot notation I'm not going to name dot dot notation I'm not going to show it here but anyway which is used to show it here but anyway which is used to show it here but anyway which is used to define to say that well this aesthetic define to say that well this aesthetic define to say that well this aesthetic is scrapped from the stat it does not is scrapped from the stat it does not is scrapped from the stat it does not exist in the data that I pass in weight exist in the data that I pass in weight exist in the data that I pass in weight with the valuation of this aesthetic with the valuation of this aesthetic with the valuation of this aesthetic until after the statistics has been until after the statistics has been until after the statistics has been calculated this kind of a weird concept calculated this kind of a weird concept calculated this kind of a weird concept but in the new version of ggplot2 we but in the new version of ggplot2 we but in the new version of ggplot2 we have this we have kind of consolidated have this we have kind of consolidated have this we have kind of consolidated all these ideas and instead of stat or all these ideas and instead of stat or all these ideas and instead of stat or thought that we have this after thought that we have this after thought that we have this after underscore stat function which is used underscore stat function which is used underscore stat function which is used to to mark an expression for evaluation to to mark an expression for evaluation to to mark an expression for evaluation after the statistics has been calculated after the statistics has been calculated after the statistics has been calculated and I know this all sounds probably very and I know this all sounds probably very and I know this all sounds probably very very weird but for an example if you very weird but for an example if you very weird but for an example if you have GM bar and it has to it calculates have GM bar and it has to it calculates have GM bar and it has to it calculates count and instead of count you actually count and instead of count you actually count and instead of count you actually want to have percentage of the whole now want to have percentage of the whole now want to have percentage of the whole now you can really access count outside you can really access count outside you can really access count outside outside of your data because it's only outside of your data because it's only outside of your data because it's only getting calculated when plotting right getting calculated when plotting right getting calculated when plotting right so what you can do is that you can have so what you can do is that you can have so what you can do is that you can have inside after stat you can map Y to 100 inside after stat you can map Y to 100 inside after stat you can map Y to 100 times count which is getting calculated times count which is getting calculated times count which is getting calculated by this debt and and divided by the by this debt and and divided by the by this debt and and divided by the total of count and then we get the total of count and then we get the total of count and then we get the percent wise values for each bar instead percent wise values for each bar instead percent wise values for each bar instead right bit weird and it's it's okay to right bit weird and it's it's okay to right bit weird and it's it's okay to not grasp it completely but it's it's not grasp it completely but it's it's not grasp it completely but it's it's it's kind of a good thing to gradually it's kind of a good thing to gradually it's kind of a good thing to gradually begin to learn and get begin to learn and get begin to learn and get comfortable world especially because comfortable world especially because comfortable world especially because many stats provides a lot of different many stats provides a lot of different many stats provides a lot of different calculated values so step count for calculated values so step count for calculated values so step count for instant for instance also have proportion which is if you have multiple proportion which is if you have multiple proportion which is if you have multiple groups within the same within the same x groups within the same within the same x groups within the same within the same x position then the proportion will give position then the proportion will give position then the proportion will give you the proportion of each group within you the proportion of each group within you the proportion of each group within that and so on and you can access these that and so on and you can access these that and so on and you can access these with the axis that function so for with the axis that function so for with the axis that function so for instance so for instance here we have instance so for instance here we have instance so for instance here we have Jim density which cross the density Jim density which cross the density Jim density which cross the density curve for for mpg and for the highway curve for for mpg and for the highway curve for for mpg and for the highway yield that means how much how many yield that means how much how many yield that means how much how many gallons of fuel does it take to to move gallons of fuel does it take to to move gallons of fuel does it take to to move the car and the default is to give the car and the default is to give the car and the default is to give density at any given point but a lot of density at any given point but a lot of density at any given point but a lot of other things have been been calculated other things have been been calculated other things have been been calculated for us for us for us for instance the stat density also for instance the stat density also for instance the stat density also calculate a scaled version of the calculate a scaled version of the calculate a scaled version of the density and if you want to use that density and if you want to use that density and if you want to use that instead of the default you just simply instead of the default you just simply instead of the default you just simply do it by it by saying after stat and do it by it by saying after stat and do it by it by saying after stat and then just grab the other calculated then just grab the other calculated then just grab the other calculated column which is called scaled now how do column which is called scaled now how do column which is called scaled now how do I know which kind of things that a I know which kind of things that a I know which kind of things that a different statistics is calculating how different statistics is calculating how different statistics is calculating how do I know what can get accessed any way do I know what can get accessed any way do I know what can get accessed any way well I think GT platoons is pretty well I think GT platoons is pretty well I think GT platoons is pretty reasonable documented and if we just reasonable documented and if we just reasonable documented and if we just jump down here and say ask ask are about jump down here and say ask ask are about jump down here and say ask ask are about it there we go so if we look at the the it there we go so if we look at the the it there we go so if we look at the the documentation for GM density and step documentation for GM density and step documentation for GM density and step density as we see here I scroll way way density as we see here I scroll way way density as we see here I scroll way way way way way way down just as before we way way way way down just as before we way way way way down just as before we see we get to the esthetic pad up here see we get to the esthetic pad up here see we get to the esthetic pad up here and we get to below that we have and we get to below that we have and we get to below that we have something called something called something called computer variables and the this is the computer variables and the this is the computer variables and the this is the output of the stat so it defines here we output of the stat so it defines here we output of the stat so it defines here we have one computed out output is density have one computed out output is density have one computed out output is density which is the density estimate then we which is the density estimate then we which is the density estimate then we also have count and it defines how also have count and it defines how also have count and it defines how countless actually calculated we have countless actually calculated we have countless actually calculated we have scaled we have n density so on and and scaled we have n density so on and and scaled we have n density so on and and every stat will have this if they are every stat will have this if they are every stat will have this if they are calculating new stuff and so you can you calculating new stuff and so you can you calculating new stuff and so you can you can again go into the help entries and can again go into the help entries and can again go into the help entries and figure out this stuff okay okay so that figure out this stuff okay okay so that figure out this stuff okay okay so that was that I hope that I have demystify was that I hope that I have demystify was that I hope that I have demystify this a bit this a bit this a bit I know stats are kind of a weird concept I know stats are kind of a weird concept I know stats are kind of a weird concept and I've said that a lot of times now and I've said that a lot of times now and I've said that a lot of times now and it's simply to make sure that you and it's simply to make sure that you and it's simply to make sure that you don't feel bad about being a little don't feel bad about being a little don't feel bad about being a little freaked out about what stats are and if freaked out about what stats are and if freaked out about what stats are and if you don't feel freaked out about it it's you don't feel freaked out about it it's you don't feel freaked out about it it's just perfect but but it is a bit weird just perfect but but it is a bit weird just perfect but but it is a bit weird but but you can simply think about it as but but you can simply think about it as but but you can simply think about it as a pre plotting transformation of your a pre plotting transformation of your a pre plotting transformation of your data and that transformation could just data and that transformation could just data and that transformation could just as well happen in your own code before as well happen in your own code before as well happen in your own code before you do the plotting but often times it's you do the plotting but often times it's you do the plotting but often times it's just much more convenient that it's just much more convenient that it's just much more convenient that it's going getting done as part of the the going getting done as part of the the going getting done as part of the the plotting routine and the status plotting routine and the status plotting routine and the status responsible with that and the stat can responsible with that and the stat can responsible with that and the stat can calculate a lot of different things that calculate a lot of different things that calculate a lot of different things that you may want to use and sometimes it's you may want to use and sometimes it's you may want to use and sometimes it's just completely completely invisible to just completely completely invisible to just completely completely invisible to you and sometimes you want to take you and sometimes you want to take you and sometimes you want to take control of it's right but it's simply control of it's right but it's simply control of it's right but it's simply just a data transformation pipeline that just a data transformation pipeline that just a data transformation pipeline that sits in between your definition of the sits in between your definition of the sits in between your definition of the input data and the geometry that's input data and the geometry that's input data and the geometry that's getting a show okay getting a show okay getting a show okay after stat is defined where so it was after stat is defined where so it was after stat is defined where so it was just a question from the chat that I just a question from the chat that I just a question from the chat that I quickly store quickly store quickly store so after status new which means that it so after status new which means that it so after status new which means that it is new in three point 3.0 so if you have is new in three point 3.0 so if you have is new in three point 3.0 so if you have not upgraded ggplot2 it doesn't exist if not upgraded ggplot2 it doesn't exist if not upgraded ggplot2 it doesn't exist if you have upgraded ggplot2 you have upgraded ggplot2 you have upgraded ggplot2 it should exist and it it takes over it should exist and it it takes over it should exist and it it takes over from the old stat function and from the from the old stat function and from the from the old stat function and from the very old tattered function now the the very old tattered function now the the very old tattered function now the the very old that that function and slightly very old that that function and slightly very old that that function and slightly less old stat function will continue to less old stat function will continue to less old stat function will continue to function and work I don't know for how function and work I don't know for how function and work I don't know for how long but for a long foreseeable future long but for a long foreseeable future long but for a long foreseeable future like we don't just yank out like we don't just yank out like we don't just yank out functionality from GG's plot - and and functionality from GG's plot - and and functionality from GG's plot - and and make all your code break but after stat make all your code break but after stat make all your code break but after stat is it's the new vetted version the is it's the new vetted version the is it's the new vetted version the reason why we have added it is because reason why we have added it is because reason why we have added it is because that we have also added something called that we have also added something called that we have also added something called after scale which is which is a after scale which is which is a after scale which is which is a completely new concept but also because completely new concept but also because completely new concept but also because that is kind of it doesn't really define that is kind of it doesn't really define that is kind of it doesn't really define what it means so after status more what it means so after status more what it means so after status more verbose in the sense that it says after verbose in the sense that it says after verbose in the sense that it says after the statistics has been calculated do the statistics has been calculated do the statistics has been calculated do this grab it from here so we think it's this grab it from here so we think it's this grab it from here so we think it's it's it's a bit more clear and in in the it's it's a bit more clear and in in the it's it's a bit more clear and in in the API what it's actually happening even API what it's actually happening even API what it's actually happening even though you have to type a bit more but though you have to type a bit more but though you have to type a bit more but we think that's that's worth it okay so we are getting two scales now I okay so we are getting two scales now I okay so we are getting two scales now I should remember that now we should should remember that now we should should remember that now we should probably have some exercises when it probably have some exercises when it probably have some exercises when it comes to two scales and I missed up comes to two scales and I missed up comes to two scales and I missed up something here there we go okay so there something here there we go okay so there something here there we go okay so there are some exercises for this test as well are some exercises for this test as well are some exercises for this test as well that we'll just go through down here so that we'll just go through down here so that we'll just go through down here so here we have our favorite power plot here we have our favorite power plot here we have our favorite power plot again and then we talked about most again and then we talked about most again and then we talked about most people use GM underscore whatever to add people use GM underscore whatever to add people use GM underscore whatever to add layers to your plot but it is actually layers to your plot but it is actually layers to your plot but it is actually just as valid to to a stats instead and just as valid to to a stats instead and just as valid to to a stats instead and they will have an attached geom and they they will have an attached geom and they they will have an attached geom and they will have a default view and so it asked will have a default view and so it asked will have a default view and so it asked me to look at Jim bond figure out which me to look at Jim bond figure out which me to look at Jim bond figure out which standard you syste fall we've already standard you syste fall we've already standard you syste fall we've already talked about that it's it's Jim count or talked about that it's it's Jim count or talked about that it's it's Jim count or step count step count step count and and then modify the coach yu's and and then modify the coach yu's and and then modify the coach yu's that's that directly instead so how that's that directly instead so how that's that directly instead so how would we do that well we will simply say would we do that well we will simply say would we do that well we will simply say is that count and no because I am is that count and no because I am is that count and no because I am horribly at spelling is that count and horribly at spelling is that count and horribly at spelling is that count and we get exactly the same result now the we get exactly the same result now the we get exactly the same result now the reason we get exactly the same result is reason we get exactly the same result is reason we get exactly the same result is that the default GM for stat is power that the default GM for stat is power that the default GM for stat is power but we could set do something funky and but we could set do something funky and but we could set do something funky and say Jim equal Y instead now what will we say Jim equal Y instead now what will we say Jim equal Y instead now what will we get then I will get this slightly get then I will get this slightly get then I will get this slightly useless plug but anyway just to say to useless plug but anyway just to say to useless plug but anyway just to say to show that that geum's have defaults show that that geum's have defaults show that that geum's have defaults tests which you can override if it makes tests which you can override if it makes tests which you can override if it makes sense but stats have default gyms that sense but stats have default gyms that sense but stats have default gyms that you can also override if that makes you can also override if that makes you can also override if that makes sense to you so you're actually in sense to you so you're actually in sense to you so you're actually in complete control but usually you don't complete control but usually you don't complete control but usually you don't mess with that unless you know exactly mess with that unless you know exactly mess with that unless you know exactly what you want to achieve because the what you want to achieve because the what you want to achieve because the defaults are are pretty sensible okay so defaults are are pretty sensible okay so defaults are are pretty sensible okay so the next the next question you stat the next the next question you stat the next the next question you stat summary to add a red dot at the mean summary to add a red dot at the mean summary to add a red dot at the mean it's W Y for each group so let's just it's W Y for each group so let's just it's W Y for each group so let's just look at the plot first okay we have this look at the plot first okay we have this look at the plot first okay we have this it's a jitter plot using G of jitter and it's a jitter plot using G of jitter and it's a jitter plot using G of jitter and we we have the points grouped by the we we have the points grouped by the we we have the points grouped by the different different classes and then we different different classes and then we different different classes and then we have highway yield on the y-axis and it have highway yield on the y-axis and it have highway yield on the y-axis and it asks us to add a red dot at the mean asks us to add a red dot at the mean asks us to add a red dot at the mean value for each of these groups so what value for each of these groups so what value for each of these groups so what we want to do is to use step summary we want to do is to use step summary we want to do is to use step summary which is a stat that allows us to pass which is a stat that allows us to pass which is a stat that allows us to pass in a function that calculates something in a function that calculates something in a function that calculates something sort like we're actually in very much sort like we're actually in very much sort like we're actually in very much complete control that's summary and we'll have the same that's summary and we'll have the same that's summary and we'll have the same mapping again so X is equal mapping again so X is equal mapping again so X is equal and Y is equal this and then we can see and Y is equal this and then we can see and Y is equal this and then we can see we have some different we have some we have some different we have some we have some different we have some functions that can that can calculate functions that can that can calculate functions that can that can calculate different different things around our different different things around our different different things around our data and we just use fun here how does data and we just use fun here how does data and we just use fun here how does it mean now what happens if we do that I it mean now what happens if we do that I it mean now what happens if we do that I actually don't know let's see well it actually don't know let's see well it actually don't know let's see well it did something like there's a bigger did something like there's a bigger did something like there's a bigger point in the middle maybe you can see point in the middle maybe you can see point in the middle maybe you can see that but anyway I removed seven rows that but anyway I removed seven rows that but anyway I removed seven rows containing missing values gym segment containing missing values gym segment containing missing values gym segment that is weird right gym section we that is weird right gym section we that is weird right gym section we didn't talk about gym segment in any didn't talk about gym segment in any didn't talk about gym segment in any part of our code up here this is part of our code up here this is part of our code up here this is actually because the the default giome actually because the the default giome actually because the the default giome for stat summary let's just have a look for stat summary let's just have a look for stat summary let's just have a look at that summary summary the default geom at that summary summary the default geom at that summary summary the default geom is point range now that's the different is point range now that's the different is point range now that's the different gym we haven't talked about that and we gym we haven't talked about that and we gym we haven't talked about that and we don't really need to talk about that don't really need to talk about that don't really need to talk about that right now but safe to say that we did right now but safe to say that we did right now but safe to say that we did not we did not provide enough not we did not provide enough not we did not provide enough information for the point range gym and information for the point range gym and information for the point range gym and doesn't matter because here we just want doesn't matter because here we just want doesn't matter because here we just want to add a point so we say gym equals a to add a point so we say gym equals a to add a point so we say gym equals a point and we also set the color to red point and we also set the color to red point and we also set the color to red right let's see if that makes sense okay right let's see if that makes sense okay right let's see if that makes sense okay it's a bit small let's make it bigger as it's a bit small let's make it bigger as it's a bit small let's make it bigger as well it's a bit bigger now okay so here we here we have a stat summary so here we here we have a stat summary so here we here we have a stat summary that allows us to define various that allows us to define various that allows us to define various different summary statistics for different summary statistics for different summary statistics for calculating a single value for a single calculating a single value for a single calculating a single value for a single value for four groups of data and we value for four groups of data and we value for four groups of data and we could change this to be median for could change this to be median for could change this to be median for instance and we get a slightly different instance and we get a slightly different instance and we get a slightly different different output as well okay oh I even different output as well okay oh I even different output as well okay oh I even gave a hint you'll need to change the gave a hint you'll need to change the gave a hint you'll need to change the default key Jim there we go okay we will default key Jim there we go okay we will default key Jim there we go okay we will back to scales now so if you remember back to scales now so if you remember back to scales now so if you remember from the first part scales is used for from the first part scales is used for from the first part scales is used for every type of mapping so if we map every type of mapping so if we map every type of mapping so if we map something from our data to an aesthetic something from our data to an aesthetic something from our data to an aesthetic then we need to scale it because for then we need to scale it because for then we need to scale it because for instance classes of cars like SUV instance classes of cars like SUV instance classes of cars like SUV doesn't have a geometric representation doesn't have a geometric representation doesn't have a geometric representation right we need to to convert it to right we need to to convert it to right we need to to convert it to something else that makes sense in a something else that makes sense in a something else that makes sense in a planning context and the scales does planning context and the scales does planning context and the scales does that so everything that you put inside that so everything that you put inside that so everything that you put inside the ears call will have a scale and and the ears call will have a scale and and the ears call will have a scale and and if you don't provide anything by adding if you don't provide anything by adding if you don't provide anything by adding to it it will get a default one and it to it it will get a default one and it to it it will get a default one and it will pick something that is kind of will pick something that is kind of will pick something that is kind of sensible and it will pick a default sensible and it will pick a default sensible and it will pick a default based on the the type of data that you based on the the type of data that you based on the the type of data that you have met so it's discrete or continuous have met so it's discrete or continuous have met so it's discrete or continuous so on and so forth and this is why we so on and so forth and this is why we so on and so forth and this is why we haven't really needed it before because haven't really needed it before because haven't really needed it before because it simply just picks reasonable defaults it simply just picks reasonable defaults it simply just picks reasonable defaults for us but if you want to take control for us but if you want to take control for us but if you want to take control you have to add them specifically and you have to add them specifically and you have to add them specifically and scales follow see my predictable name is scales follow see my predictable name is scales follow see my predictable name is you in the same way that you have GM you in the same way that you have GM you in the same way that you have GM underscore you have scale underscore and underscore you have scale underscore and underscore you have scale underscore and then we have the name of the aesthetics then we have the name of the aesthetics then we have the name of the aesthetics for so for instance for so for instance for so for instance we have scale on the score collar and we have scale on the score collar and we have scale on the score collar and then we may have underscore or something then we may have underscore or something then we may have underscore or something else and that's something else is why I else and that's something else is why I else and that's something else is why I see my predictable because it might be see my predictable because it might be see my predictable because it might be scale underscore color underscore scale underscore color underscore scale underscore color underscore continues which which gives kind of the continues which which gives kind of the continues which which gives kind of the type of the interpretation of the data type of the interpretation of the data type of the interpretation of the data but especially for color we have all all but especially for color we have all all but especially for color we have all all these weird different color palettes and these weird different color palettes and these weird different color palettes and they can they can be named in this type they can they can be named in this type they can they can be named in this type argument as well so the last part of the argument as well so the last part of the argument as well so the last part of the scale name is kind of unpredictable yeah scale name is kind of unpredictable yeah scale name is kind of unpredictable yeah I just had to collect my thoughts there I just had to collect my thoughts there I just had to collect my thoughts there okay so let's have a look here so up okay so let's have a look here so up okay so let's have a look here so up here as we've kind of seen this before here as we've kind of seen this before here as we've kind of seen this before we don't own we're not only mapping x we don't own we're not only mapping x we don't own we're not only mapping x and y we're also mapping colors to and y we're also mapping colors to and y we're also mapping colors to something we met in the color to class something we met in the color to class something we met in the color to class and and what did you put two does in and and what did you put two does in and and what did you put two does in this instance is that it looks into what this instance is that it looks into what this instance is that it looks into what type of mixer is class like the the type of mixer is class like the the type of mixer is class like the the result of the of evaluating class in the result of the of evaluating class in the result of the of evaluating class in the context of mpg which results in the the context of mpg which results in the the context of mpg which results in the the class column in mpg what type is that is class column in mpg what type is that is class column in mpg what type is that is it a number is it is it a character it a number is it is it a character it a number is it is it a character vector is the fact so make sure it's vector is the fact so make sure it's vector is the fact so make sure it's date column like what kind of thing is date column like what kind of thing is date column like what kind of thing is it it it and it looks into the class and you can and it looks into the class and you can and it looks into the class and you can see well this is a thing as effexor xr see well this is a thing as effexor xr see well this is a thing as effexor xr not a victor Thanks not a victor Thanks not a victor Thanks and so it says well this is discrete and so it says well this is discrete and so it says well this is discrete data so we map a discrete scholar scale data so we map a discrete scholar scale data so we map a discrete scholar scale to it and it just picks the default one to it and it just picks the default one to it and it just picks the default one which is it's this one and it's not which is it's this one and it's not which is it's this one and it's not necessarily pretty but it works but it's necessarily pretty but it works but it's necessarily pretty but it works but it's there and it kind of works and it there and it kind of works and it there and it kind of works and it creates all by itself it creates this creates all by itself it creates this creates all by itself it creates this nice legend for us so we can understand nice legend for us so we can understand nice legend for us so we can understand the color mapping and map back and forth the color mapping and map back and forth the color mapping and map back and forth now this is not a great plug a lot of now this is not a great plug a lot of now this is not a great plug a lot of the plus I'm showing you a not great the plus I'm showing you a not great the plus I'm showing you a not great they were meant for illustrating the they were meant for illustrating the they were meant for illustrating the the API more

want to map to Sita to something we want to map to Sita to something other than dress because we don't like other than dress because we don't like other than dress because we don't like this this tinder red or whatever well we this this tinder red or whatever well we this this tinder red or whatever well we need to add a scale to it and kind of need to add a scale to it and kind of need to add a scale to it and kind of take control and say we don't want to take control and say we don't want to take control and say we don't want to use the default we once you use this one use the default we once you use this one use the default we once you use this one right so so after we have defined our right so so after we have defined our right so so after we have defined our our layer we can add this scale color our layer we can add this scale color our layer we can add this scale color and then we say ruler now what screw and then we say ruler now what screw and then we say ruler now what screw there is a color color collection of there is a color color collection of there is a color color collection of color palettes called color blue which color palettes called color blue which color palettes called color blue which are quite sensible generally they are are quite sensible generally they are are quite sensible generally they are sensible in the in the sense that colors sensible in the in the sense that colors sensible in the in the sense that colors have been chosen so that they are have been chosen so that they are have been chosen so that they are perceptually uniform and there's not a perceptually uniform and there's not a perceptually uniform and there's not a single color that Springs out in your single color that Springs out in your single color that Springs out in your mind and generally the the palettes that mind and generally the the palettes that mind and generally the the palettes that you have in in color brewer are designed you have in in color brewer are designed you have in in color brewer are designed in a way so you you won't cheat yourself in a way so you you won't cheat yourself in a way so you you won't cheat yourself and you want sheet the peed the the and you want sheet the peed the the and you want sheet the peed the the persons that you're trying to persons that you're trying to persons that you're trying to communicate with so they are not communicate with so they are not communicate with so they are not necessarily all of them beautiful but necessarily all of them beautiful but necessarily all of them beautiful but they're good step in starting stone in they're good step in starting stone in they're good step in starting stone in terms of of picking some new palace terms of of picking some new palace terms of of picking some new palace without making horrible choices and without making horrible choices and without making horrible choices and color is super important and once more I color is super important and once more I color is super important and once more I will not go into much detail here but will not go into much detail here but will not go into much detail here but color color is one of the it's one of color color is one of the it's one of color color is one of the it's one of those things that you can you can create those things that you can you can create those things that you can you can create beautiful plus with beautiful color and beautiful plus with beautiful color and beautiful plus with beautiful color and you'll end up fooling yourself because you'll end up fooling yourself because you'll end up fooling yourself because the colors are actually not picked in a the colors are actually not picked in a the colors are actually not picked in a way that so that they represent the data way that so that they represent the data way that so that they represent the data correctly you may also use it for correctly you may also use it for correctly you may also use it for nefarious means don't do that I don't nefarious means don't do that I don't nefarious means don't do that I don't hope I have to say that but don't try to hope I have to say that but don't try to hope I have to say that but don't try to cheat with your visualizations but cheat with your visualizations but cheat with your visualizations but usually people don't usually people don't do this willfully usually people don't do this willfully usually people don't do this willfully but they may end up cheating or fooling but they may end up cheating or fooling but they may end up cheating or fooling people with their visualisations because people with their visualisations because people with their visualisations because color can can be so difficult to work color can can be so difficult to work color can can be so difficult to work with and the color Brewer is a good with and the color Brewer is a good with and the color Brewer is a good starting point because they have been starting point because they have been starting point because they have been designed in a way that that makes sense designed in a way that that makes sense designed in a way that that makes sense the same is true for Reedus which is a the same is true for Reedus which is a the same is true for Reedus which is a continuous color scale that is that continuous color scale that is that continuous color scale that is that tries to to be to be good at not having tries to to be to be good at not having tries to to be to be good at not having any banding and have perceptually any banding and have perceptually any banding and have perceptually uniform steps for for the same same uniform steps for for the same same uniform steps for for the same same value difference yeah anyway as you can value difference yeah anyway as you can value difference yeah anyway as you can maybe grasp color is a huge area and and maybe grasp color is a huge area and and maybe grasp color is a huge area and and I hope someone else will make a bit an I hope someone else will make a bit an I hope someone else will make a bit an hour about it because I'm not going to hour about it because I'm not going to hour about it because I'm not going to talk too much about it more okay anyway talk too much about it more okay anyway talk too much about it more okay anyway we can take over the the default scale we can take over the the default scale we can take over the the default scale by adding its explicitly and we do that by adding its explicitly and we do that by adding its explicitly and we do that here with scale colored Brewer and as I here with scale colored Brewer and as I here with scale colored Brewer and as I say here say here say here well scale naming is kind of predictable well scale naming is kind of predictable well scale naming is kind of predictable but everything inside the function the but everything inside the function the but everything inside the function the scale function is not that predictable scale function is not that predictable scale function is not that predictable there are some arguments that that will there are some arguments that that will there are some arguments that that will appear in all scales like for instance appear in all scales like for instance appear in all scales like for instance you can give a name to the scale so you can give a name to the scale so you can give a name to the scale so instead of just grabbing the name class instead of just grabbing the name class instead of just grabbing the name class that you see in the legend instead of that you see in the legend instead of that you see in the legend instead of just grabbing that from the madding and just grabbing that from the madding and just grabbing that from the madding and the scene Jim point we can give the scene Jim point we can give the scene Jim point we can give something explicitly let's just try that something explicitly let's just try that something explicitly let's just try that for more fun there we go so this is the plot where we're looking so this is the plot where we're looking so this is the plot where we're looking at right and so every every scale will at right and so every every scale will at right and so every every scale will have a name argument where we can say us have a name argument where we can say us have a name argument where we can say us because we look like we like all caps because we look like we like all caps because we look like we like all caps and we can see that the title is and we can see that the title is and we can see that the title is actually changing here right so this actually changing here right so this actually changing here right so this will be in all the scale function but will be in all the scale function but will be in all the scale function but mainly the scale of the arguments and mainly the scale of the arguments and mainly the scale of the arguments and the scale function will be specific to the scale function will be specific to the scale function will be specific to that specific scale functions that specific scale functions that specific scale functions for instance the type argument is for instance the type argument is for instance the type argument is specific to the brewer scales because it specific to the brewer scales because it specific to the brewer scales because it it understands that the Brewer scales it understands that the Brewer scales it understands that the Brewer scales has been designed in such a way that has been designed in such a way that has been designed in such a way that there are different types of scales there are different types of scales there are different types of scales there qualitative there are sequential there qualitative there are sequential there qualitative there are sequential and divergent and and you can control and divergent and and you can control and divergent and and you can control that with the type argument but that that with the type argument but that that with the type argument but that doesn't necessarily translate well to a doesn't necessarily translate well to a doesn't necessarily translate well to a shape scale for instance or whatever so shape scale for instance or whatever so shape scale for instance or whatever so you will usually have to look into the you will usually have to look into the you will usually have to look into the documentation generally when you begin documentation generally when you begin documentation generally when you begin to use a new part of the API Fuji you've to use a new part of the API Fuji you've to use a new part of the API Fuji you've got to just that by reading the got to just that by reading the got to just that by reading the documentation because a lot of the documentation because a lot of the documentation because a lot of the information is already available in information is already available in information is already available in there and and there is there are simply there and and there is there are simply there and and there is there are simply a lot of information and you can't be a lot of information and you can't be a lot of information and you can't be expected to understand that on the expected to understand that on the expected to understand that on the get-go so just sit down and and read the get-go so just sit down and and read the get-go so just sit down and and read the documentation to figure out where all documentation to figure out where all documentation to figure out where all the different nuts and bolts are for the different nuts and bolts are for the different nuts and bolts are for right okay back to scales now when right okay back to scales now when right okay back to scales now when you're talking about scales you you may you're talking about scales you you may you're talking about scales you you may think about many color and shape scales think about many color and shape scales think about many color and shape scales but x and y are also controllable scales but x and y are also controllable scales but x and y are also controllable scales and if you have continuous x and y and if you have continuous x and y and if you have continuous x and y values you're using scale underscore x values you're using scale underscore x values you're using scale underscore x occur on the score continues and scale occur on the score continues and scale occur on the score continues and scale underscore Y and score continuous and underscore Y and score continuous and underscore Y and score continuous and you can use that both to change the name you can use that both to change the name you can use that both to change the name as we just saw but we can also use that as we just saw but we can also use that as we just saw but we can also use that to change things such as where do we see to change things such as where do we see to change things such as where do we see breaks where do we see gridlines we do breaks where do we see gridlines we do breaks where do we see gridlines we do that for the the X scale here where we that for the the X scale here where we that for the the X scale here where we said well we don't only want breaks or said well we don't only want breaks or said well we don't only want breaks or gridlines at 3 5 &amp; 6 and for the for the gridlines at 3 5 &amp; 6 and for the for the gridlines at 3 5 &amp; 6 and for the for the y scale we set a transformation now the y scale we set a transformation now the y scale we set a transformation now the transformations that's something new but transformations that's something new but transformations that's something new but every scale has a transformation built every scale has a transformation built every scale has a transformation built into it as well and again usually the into it as well and again usually the into it as well and again usually the transformation is the identity transformation is the identity transformation is the identity transformation which means do not transformation which means do not transformation which means do not transform the data but sometimes you may transform the data but sometimes you may transform the data but sometimes you may want to transform the data for instance want to transform the data for instance want to transform the data for instance you want to have your data be lock you want to have your data be lock you want to have your data be lock transformed as we do here transformed as we do here transformed as we do here and we say trends equals luck 10 now of and we say trends equals luck 10 now of and we say trends equals luck 10 now of course because a lot of people want this course because a lot of people want this course because a lot of people want this their data luck transformed we already their data luck transformed we already their data luck transformed we already have a building shortcut for it so you have a building shortcut for it so you have a building shortcut for it so you can also ask a LAN just go why on the can also ask a LAN just go why on the can also ask a LAN just go why on the score luck 10 so use it as however you score luck 10 so use it as however you score luck 10 so use it as however you want it so those scales and I think I have some so those scales and I think I have some so those scales and I think I have some amazing amazing exercises about that as amazing amazing exercises about that as amazing amazing exercises about that as well let's see exercises ok so we have well let's see exercises ok so we have well let's see exercises ok so we have this plot here which is the plot we saw this plot here which is the plot we saw this plot here which is the plot we saw before right use our color Brio display before right use our color Brio display before right use our color Brio display blue all to see all the different blue all to see all the different blue all to see all the different palettes from Calabria and figure favors palettes from Calabria and figure favors palettes from Calabria and figure favors modify the code below to use it so we'll modify the code below to use it so we'll modify the code below to use it so we'll need to call this function let's just need to call this function let's just need to call this function let's just put it down here ok so so when you call put it down here ok so so when you call put it down here ok so so when you call this function this is not a nice plot this function this is not a nice plot this function this is not a nice plot there's simply not enough space to show there's simply not enough space to show there's simply not enough space to show the names of all of these nicely but the names of all of these nicely but the names of all of these nicely but anyway so these are all the different anyway so these are all the different anyway so these are all the different palettes that you can use from from the palettes that you can use from from the palettes that you can use from from the color Brewer and these are all color Brewer and these are all color Brewer and these are all accessible through scale color accessible through scale color accessible through scale color underscore Brewer and when we say type underscore Brewer and when we say type underscore Brewer and when we say type equals qual we say type equals quote we equals qual we say type equals quote we equals qual we say type equals quote we just say well our data is qualitative so just say well our data is qualitative so just say well our data is qualitative so use one of the the qualitative color use one of the the qualitative color use one of the the qualitative color scales which are those in the middle scales which are those in the middle scales which are those in the middle here here here it's called stitch with a three said to it's called stitch with a three said to it's called stitch with a three said to pestle 2 X n 2 and so on and it will pestle 2 X n 2 and so on and it will pestle 2 X n 2 and so on and it will just pick the first one which is just pick the first one which is just pick the first one which is excellent and in the same way if we said excellent and in the same way if we said excellent and in the same way if we said that it was divergent it would just pick that it was divergent it would just pick that it was divergent it would just pick the first one of those now I don't know the first one of those now I don't know the first one of those now I don't know about you but I really really like set about you but I really really like set about you but I really really like set one so instead of just saying which type one so instead of just saying which type one so instead of just saying which type it is I can name the palace directly it is I can name the palace directly it is I can name the palace directly with the palette argument and we'll have a new palette argument and we'll have a new palette argument and we'll have a new palette one that is really nice one that is really nice one that is really nice so so this single function scale color so so this single function scale color so so this single function scale color brew has a lot of different color brew has a lot of different color brew has a lot of different color palettes build into it and as we'll talk palettes build into it and as we'll talk palettes build into it and as we'll talk about later there's a lot of extensions about later there's a lot of extensions about later there's a lot of extensions that provide even more different color that provide even more different color that provide even more different color scales especially access to different scales especially access to different scales especially access to different many different palettes so if you're many different palettes so if you're many different palettes so if you're just looking at adding a sprinkle of just looking at adding a sprinkle of just looking at adding a sprinkle of color to your plus like the world will color to your plus like the world will color to your plus like the world will provide for you and we'll talk more provide for you and we'll talk more provide for you and we'll talk more about that later ok so we have a plot about that later ok so we have a plot about that later ok so we have a plot here not a beautiful plot I will mainly here not a beautiful plot I will mainly here not a beautiful plot I will mainly promise you that none of my plots will promise you that none of my plots will promise you that none of my plots will be beautiful but they will be educated be beautiful but they will be educated be beautiful but they will be educated and the question is modify the code and the question is modify the code and the question is modify the code below to create a bubble chart a bubble below to create a bubble chart a bubble below to create a bubble chart a bubble chart is a scatter plot where size is chart is a scatter plot where size is chart is a scatter plot where size is also mapped to a continuous variable and also mapped to a continuous variable and also mapped to a continuous variable and oh my god I have forgotten to to delete oh my god I have forgotten to to delete oh my god I have forgotten to to delete the solution I'm spoiling everything for the solution I'm spoiling everything for the solution I'm spoiling everything for you this should be the second one said you this should be the second one said you this should be the second one said okay with size map two continuous okay with size map two continuous okay with size map two continuous variables showing cylinders with size variables showing cylinders with size variables showing cylinders with size make sure that only the present amount make sure that only the present amount make sure that only the present amount of cylinders four five six and eight are of cylinders four five six and eight are of cylinders four five six and eight are present in the legend okay so what are present in the legend okay so what are present in the legend okay so what are we going to do well we mapping size to we going to do well we mapping size to we going to do well we mapping size to still there okay still there okay still there okay now this doesn't look like we had it now this doesn't look like we had it now this doesn't look like we had it before right so the first question is or before right so the first question is or before right so the first question is or the second question is to make sure that the second question is to make sure that the second question is to make sure that only the the present amount of cylinders only the the present amount of cylinders only the the present amount of cylinders five four five six and eight are present five four five six and eight are present five four five six and eight are present in the legend now in the legend here in the legend now in the legend here in the legend now in the legend here it's also generated and it just it just it's also generated and it just it just it's also generated and it just it just takes the range of your data and defines takes the range of your data and defines takes the range of your data and defines five equidistant breakpoints and shows five equidistant breakpoints and shows five equidistant breakpoints and shows the size for that the size for that the size for that now we have a set amount of up sizes and now we have a set amount of up sizes and now we have a set amount of up sizes and we may want to just show those because we may want to just show those because we may want to just show those because here this implies that we have an entity here this implies that we have an entity here this implies that we have an entity with seven cylinders which we don't so with seven cylinders which we don't so with seven cylinders which we don't so so this legend is kind of not cheating so this legend is kind of not cheating so this legend is kind of not cheating but it's it's kind of confusing to to but it's it's kind of confusing to to but it's it's kind of confusing to to read this so the way we do that is that read this so the way we do that is that read this so the way we do that is that we say scale size and we'll just say we say scale size and we'll just say we say scale size and we'll just say scale size no just scale size and we'll scale size no just scale size and we'll scale size no just scale size and we'll say breaks equals four five six and say breaks equals four five six and say breaks equals four five six and eight and now we can see that our legend eight and now we can see that our legend eight and now we can see that our legend correctly reflects what we what we have correctly reflects what we what we have correctly reflects what we what we have in our data now this this mapping let's in our data now this this mapping let's in our data now this this mapping let's just talk about that for a while because just talk about that for a while because just talk about that for a while because this mapping kind of looks weird it this mapping kind of looks weird it this mapping kind of looks weird it feels like four is mapped way too small feels like four is mapped way too small feels like four is mapped way too small compared to the others now mapping sizes compared to the others now mapping sizes compared to the others now mapping sizes is generally a tricky thing and and when is generally a tricky thing and and when is generally a tricky thing and and when you when you just close your eyes and you when you just close your eyes and you when you just close your eyes and think about how you want to do that then think about how you want to do that then think about how you want to do that then the easiest thing is to map it to the the easiest thing is to map it to the the easiest thing is to map it to the radius of the circle but but that will radius of the circle but but that will radius of the circle but but that will that will generally be a bad idea that will generally be a bad idea that will generally be a bad idea because when the eye look at a point it because when the eye look at a point it because when the eye look at a point it will look at the area it will not will look at the area it will not will look at the area it will not perceive the radius it will perceive the perceive the radius it will perceive the perceive the radius it will perceive the area so you want to to map it to the area so you want to to map it to the area so you want to to map it to the area instead and if your method to to area instead and if your method to to area instead and if your method to to the radius then the area will grow too the radius then the area will grow too the radius then the area will grow too fast and and last value will appear even fast and and last value will appear even fast and and last value will appear even larger in your plot so if we just show larger in your plot so if we just show larger in your plot so if we just show you can do scale you can do the bad you can do scale you can do the bad you can do scale you can do the bad thing and map its radius and it actually thing and map its radius and it actually thing and map its radius and it actually it looks better right now in some sense it looks better right now in some sense it looks better right now in some sense but if you look at it it actually feels but if you look at it it actually feels but if you look at it it actually feels like like size is increasing exponential like like size is increasing exponential like like size is increasing exponential I would say so that's a bad idea right but the other thing looks weird as well but the other thing looks weird as well but the other thing looks weird as well right like like forest is way too small right like like forest is way too small right like like forest is way too small and it feels like the jump from 4 to 5 and it feels like the jump from 4 to 5 and it feels like the jump from 4 to 5 is it's much bigger than the jump from 5 is it's much bigger than the jump from 5 is it's much bigger than the jump from 5 to 6 it actually is not bigger and you to 6 it actually is not bigger and you to 6 it actually is not bigger and you have to take my word for it it's just have to take my word for it it's just have to take my word for it it's just because four is more or less nothing and because four is more or less nothing and because four is more or less nothing and then suddenly there is something and the then suddenly there is something and the then suddenly there is something and the ANA size increase from from five to six ANA size increase from from five to six ANA size increase from from five to six from something to something more doesn't from something to something more doesn't from something to something more doesn't feel as abrupt one way to to get over feel as abrupt one way to to get over feel as abrupt one way to to get over this is to say use the scale size area this is to say use the scale size area this is to say use the scale size area the skin size area will use area scaling the skin size area will use area scaling the skin size area will use area scaling but further than that it will it will but further than that it will it will but further than that it will it will also ensure that zero and your input also ensure that zero and your input also ensure that zero and your input variables will also be mapped to a zero variables will also be mapped to a zero variables will also be mapped to a zero size in your in your in plot so we have size in your in your in plot so we have size in your in your in plot so we have a much more natural progression of sizes a much more natural progression of sizes a much more natural progression of sizes here they are much more difficult to here they are much more difficult to here they are much more difficult to discern because the range of sizes is discern because the range of sizes is discern because the range of sizes is much more but it feels at least more much more but it feels at least more much more but it feels at least more natural and and we can make the range of natural and and we can make the range of natural and and we can make the range of sizes bigger by saying max size equals sizes bigger by saying max size equals sizes bigger by saying max size equals say instead for instance and we have a say instead for instance and we have a say instead for instance and we have a bit more spread in the sizes right okay bit more spread in the sizes right okay bit more spread in the sizes right okay I think that was what I wanted to say I think that was what I wanted to say I think that was what I wanted to say about that okay modify the code below so about that okay modify the code below so about that okay modify the code below so that color is no longer maps in the that color is no longer maps in the that color is no longer maps in the discrete class variable but to the discrete class variable but to the discrete class variable but to the continuous city city yield variable what continuous city city yield variable what continuous city city yield variable what happens to the guy okay so we have this happens to the guy okay so we have this happens to the guy okay so we have this guide here and color is currently mapped guide here and color is currently mapped guide here and color is currently mapped to class and what happens if we instead to class and what happens if we instead to class and what happens if we instead of mapping into class habit to City now city is it's new or change the stuff now city is it's new or change the stuff now city is it's new or change the stuff because suddenly city the mapping to because suddenly city the mapping to because suddenly city the mapping to color is continuous instead of discrete color is continuous instead of discrete color is continuous instead of discrete and this means that the the color and this means that the the color and this means that the the color palette will also be continuous like it palette will also be continuous like it palette will also be continuous like it will be a gradient more or less and when will be a gradient more or less and when will be a gradient more or less and when you have a continuous color mapping you have a continuous color mapping you have a continuous color mapping ggplot2 will by default choose a new ggplot2 will by default choose a new ggplot2 will by default choose a new legend for you as well which kind of legend for you as well which kind of legend for you as well which kind of shows this gradient nature of the color shows this gradient nature of the color shows this gradient nature of the color mapping now you can you can control this mapping now you can you can control this mapping now you can you can control this and there's actually the last last and there's actually the last last and there's actually the last last exercise we have this year this is the exercise we have this year this is the exercise we have this year this is the same flood right yes same flood right yes same flood right yes so you can control the type of guide so you can control the type of guide so you can control the type of guide that you the type of legend that you that you the type of legend that you that you the type of legend that you have over here and and you can do that have over here and and you can do that have over here and and you can do that either within the scale but you can also either within the scale but you can also either within the scale but you can also do it in this guy's function where you do it in this guy's function where you do it in this guy's function where you can just say color what kind of guy do can just say color what kind of guy do can just say color what kind of guy do you want for color and now the the you want for color and now the the you want for color and now the the topmost guys the one that we have topmost guys the one that we have topmost guys the one that we have precise is called a legend guide and the precise is called a legend guide and the precise is called a legend guide and the the button most the one that we have for the button most the one that we have for the button most the one that we have for color is called a color bar guide so color is called a color bar guide so color is called a color bar guide so even though that we have a have a even though that we have a have a even though that we have a have a continuous color mapping we can actually continuous color mapping we can actually continuous color mapping we can actually use the the old style the old style use the the old style the old style use the the old style the old style legend card and we can do that by just legend card and we can do that by just legend card and we can do that by just saying that the legend should be the saying that the legend should be the saying that the legend should be the color legend should be the legend time color legend should be the legend time color legend should be the legend time now what happens now now what happens now now what happens now now we have now we have two two now we have now we have two two now we have now we have two two different aesthetics both maps in the different aesthetics both maps in the different aesthetics both maps in the same variable namely City yield and they same variable namely City yield and they same variable namely City yield and they are also shown with the same type of are also shown with the same type of are also shown with the same type of guide and then ggplot2 is smart enough guide and then ggplot2 is smart enough guide and then ggplot2 is smart enough to actually understand that these two to actually understand that these two to actually understand that these two guides or these two these two guys can guides or these two these two guys can guides or these two these two guys can be collapsed into one so instead of I'm be collapsed into one so instead of I'm be collapsed into one so instead of I'm showing the two guys and the condition showing the two guys and the condition showing the two guys and the condition just yeah compress it into a single guy just yeah compress it into a single guy just yeah compress it into a single guy this is nice because there's a it makes this is nice because there's a it makes this is nice because there's a it makes makes it much more clear that both color makes it much more clear that both color makes it much more clear that both color and size is map to the same thing now and size is map to the same thing now and size is map to the same thing now the the the guide merging is not the the the guide merging is not the the the guide merging is not foolproof actually it's it's kind of foolproof actually it's it's kind of foolproof actually it's it's kind of super stupid which means that it only super stupid which means that it only super stupid which means that it only merges guides if they are exactly the merges guides if they are exactly the merges guides if they are exactly the same and if they're not exactly the same same and if they're not exactly the same same and if they're not exactly the same they will not be merged so if we for they will not be merged so if we for they will not be merged so if we for instance do scale size and give it a new instance do scale size and give it a new instance do scale size and give it a new name like we just like to show the two name like we just like to show the two name like we just like to show the two guys are no longer completely the same guys are no longer completely the same guys are no longer completely the same because they have different names and because they have different names and because they have different names and ggplot2 just gives up ggplot2 just gives up ggplot2 just gives up I don't know how much these they don't I don't know how much these they don't I don't know how much these they don't look at all like each other so I can't look at all like each other so I can't look at all like each other so I can't do anything do anything do anything so the merging is kind of stupid I hope so the merging is kind of stupid I hope so the merging is kind of stupid I hope to be able to improve it in a later to be able to improve it in a later to be able to improve it in a later version of ggplot2 in general the guy version of ggplot2 in general the guy version of ggplot2 in general the guy system is one of the old vestiges of old system is one of the old vestiges of old system is one of the old vestiges of old ggplot2 and and it's it's the only thing ggplot2 and and it's it's the only thing ggplot2 and and it's it's the only thing that is currently lacking from complete that is currently lacking from complete that is currently lacking from complete rewrite so that will probably happen and rewrite so that will probably happen and rewrite so that will probably happen and hopefully smart a guide merging will hopefully smart a guide merging will hopefully smart a guide merging will will be part of that ok and we are on will be part of that ok and we are on will be part of that ok and we are on two facets so let's jump over there okay two facets so let's jump over there okay two facets so let's jump over there okay so facets is fantastic facets are so facets is fantastic facets are so facets is fantastic facets are absolutely amazing and and should be absolutely amazing and and should be absolutely amazing and and should be used all the time almost the idea behind used all the time almost the idea behind used all the time almost the idea behind facets is that you can take your input facets is that you can take your input facets is that you can take your input data and you can split it into multiple data and you can split it into multiple data and you can split it into multiple panels now it is not the same as having panels now it is not the same as having panels now it is not the same as having multiple different plots as such because multiple different plots as such because multiple different plots as such because each panel has has the same underlying each panel has has the same underlying each panel has has the same underlying plot logic so so we will reuse the same plot logic so so we will reuse the same plot logic so so we will reuse the same scales it were scales it were scales it were use the same coordinate system it will use the same coordinate system it will use the same coordinate system it will reuse the same mapping and so on so they reuse the same mapping and so on so they reuse the same mapping and so on so they are they are the exact same are they are the exact same are they are the exact same representations of of the same plot but representations of of the same plot but representations of of the same plot but the data differ now fezzes has also been the data differ now fezzes has also been the data differ now fezzes has also been used to kind of try to combine multiple used to kind of try to combine multiple used to kind of try to combine multiple separate plots because people often want separate plots because people often want separate plots because people often want that and it has not been easy to do that that and it has not been easy to do that that and it has not been easy to do that in GD plot to for a while but it is easy in GD plot to for a while but it is easy in GD plot to for a while but it is easy now with extension packages that we will now with extension packages that we will now with extension packages that we will talk about in the next webinar so talk about in the next webinar so talk about in the next webinar so because there are absolutely better ways because there are absolutely better ways because there are absolutely better ways to do that now to do that now to do that now you should not butcher facets into you should not butcher facets into you should not butcher facets into trying to do that you should use passes trying to do that you should use passes trying to do that you should use passes if you have if you want to create small if you have if you want to create small if you have if you want to create small multiples and that's basically it if you multiples and that's basically it if you multiples and that's basically it if you want to have the same type of plot want to have the same type of plot want to have the same type of plot repeated over and over again with with repeated over and over again with with repeated over and over again with with differences in the data now one of the differences in the data now one of the differences in the data now one of the reasons why this is such a good idea reasons why this is such a good idea reasons why this is such a good idea is that it is one of the most effective is that it is one of the most effective is that it is one of the most effective ways to avoid over plotting usually all ways to avoid over plotting usually all ways to avoid over plotting usually all plotting is the concept that if you have plotting is the concept that if you have plotting is the concept that if you have simply to have too much data and tries simply to have too much data and tries simply to have too much data and tries to add points or lines so whatever to add points or lines so whatever to add points or lines so whatever inevitably it will just end up as a big inevitably it will just end up as a big inevitably it will just end up as a big blob of black or whatever like it will blob of black or whatever like it will blob of black or whatever like it will be impossible to see how many points are be impossible to see how many points are be impossible to see how many points are laid on top of each other even if you laid on top of each other even if you laid on top of each other even if you became to make make things very very became to make make things very very became to make make things very very transparent at some point you just have transparent at some point you just have transparent at some point you just have too much data and will get over plotted too much data and will get over plotted too much data and will get over plotted now one of the the best ways to combat now one of the the best ways to combat now one of the the best ways to combat that is through faceting because you get that is through faceting because you get that is through faceting because you get a lot of small multiples and small a lot of small multiples and small a lot of small multiples and small multiple sizes it's sensible because multiple sizes it's sensible because multiple sizes it's sensible because they are related to variables in your they are related to variables in your they are related to variables in your data and mentally like carnac it's data and mentally like carnac it's data and mentally like carnac it's getting laid over here getting laid over here getting laid over here your mind will actually be able to reuse your mind will actually be able to reuse your mind will actually be able to reuse the knowledge it gained from reading the the knowledge it gained from reading the the knowledge it gained from reading the first panel like it will first panel like it will first panel like it will understand how the plus should be read understand how the plus should be read understand how the plus should be read and it can apply that to all the other and it can apply that to all the other and it can apply that to all the other small multiples so it's so cognitively small multiples so it's so cognitively small multiples so it's so cognitively it's much much easier for the head to it's much much easier for the head to it's much much easier for the head to wrap around small multiples and in wrap around small multiples and in wrap around small multiples and in ggplot2 it's very very easy to do this ggplot2 it's very very easy to do this ggplot2 it's very very easy to do this kind of faceting which is also why you kind of faceting which is also why you kind of faceting which is also why you should absolutely be doing it all the should absolutely be doing it all the should absolutely be doing it all the time you plot to provides two different time you plot to provides two different time you plot to provides two different facets and facets are extendable which facets and facets are extendable which facets and facets are extendable which means that there are extension packages means that there are extension packages means that there are extension packages out there and that will provide even out there and that will provide even out there and that will provide even more different ways of faceting plots we more different ways of faceting plots we more different ways of faceting plots we may talk about them later I can't may talk about them later I can't may talk about them later I can't remember but did you plot to provides - remember but did you plot to provides - remember but did you plot to provides - one of them is called facet wrap and as one of them is called facet wrap and as one of them is called facet wrap and as we can see here the way the facet wrap we can see here the way the facet wrap we can see here the way the facet wrap works is is that it's sorry I lost my works is is that it's sorry I lost my works is is that it's sorry I lost my thread again as wrap takes a column from thread again as wrap takes a column from thread again as wrap takes a column from your data here the class column and as your data here the class column and as your data here the class column and as this this tilde which mean it kind of this this tilde which mean it kind of this this tilde which mean it kind of looks weird now but it's it's there for looks weird now but it's it's there for looks weird now but it's it's there for a reason it has this it is tilde and and a reason it has this it is tilde and and a reason it has this it is tilde and and just kind of says take the class just kind of says take the class just kind of says take the class variable map the class variables to variable map the class variables to variable map the class variables to panel and it will automatically create panel and it will automatically create panel and it will automatically create all these small subplots and as you can all these small subplots and as you can all these small subplots and as you can see the small stuff plus they they share see the small stuff plus they they share see the small stuff plus they they share the same axis so it's it's very very the same axis so it's it's very very the same axis so it's it's very very easy to compare one small subplot with easy to compare one small subplot with easy to compare one small subplot with another and it's actually just much also another and it's actually just much also another and it's actually just much also much more easy for you to compare the much more easy for you to compare the much more easy for you to compare the different classes in a small subplot different classes in a small subplot different classes in a small subplot view when compared to plotting plotting view when compared to plotting plotting view when compared to plotting plotting in a single panel and showing the in a single panel and showing the in a single panel and showing the different classes with for instance different classes with for instance different classes with for instance color or shape so this is much more easy color or shape so this is much more easy color or shape so this is much more easy for you to digest and understand because for you to digest and understand because for you to digest and understand because your eyes can focus on the different your eyes can focus on the different your eyes can focus on the different classes one at a time and make classes one at a time and make classes one at a time and make comparisons between them very very easy another type of faceting is the the another type of faceting is the the another type of faceting is the the facet grid it's kind of like facet wrap facet grid it's kind of like facet wrap facet grid it's kind of like facet wrap what we talked before here was that what we talked before here was that what we talked before here was that fasten trap just takes all the different fasten trap just takes all the different fasten trap just takes all the different classes and it just have one panel for classes and it just have one panel for classes and it just have one panel for each class and it will just wrap all the each class and it will just wrap all the each class and it will just wrap all the panels into into like a ribbon and use panels into into like a ribbon and use panels into into like a ribbon and use as many columns and rows as necessary to as many columns and rows as necessary to as many columns and rows as necessary to to show all the classes now if as this to show all the classes now if as this to show all the classes now if as this grid is a bit different it's kind of a grid is a bit different it's kind of a grid is a bit different it's kind of a graphic pivot in the sense that it can graphic pivot in the sense that it can graphic pivot in the sense that it can take two different variables and set take two different variables and set take two different variables and set them beside each other one will be on them beside each other one will be on them beside each other one will be on the columns and one will be in the row the columns and one will be in the row the columns and one will be in the row and each pal each panel will then show and each pal each panel will then show and each pal each panel will then show the intersection between the in this the intersection between the in this the intersection between the in this example here and drive example here and drive example here and drive so the first topmost top left panel will so the first topmost top left panel will so the first topmost top left panel will show all the points that are from 1999 show all the points that are from 1999 show all the points that are from 1999 and have a four-wheel drive so it's and have a four-wheel drive so it's and have a four-wheel drive so it's extremely it's very very easy to make extremely it's very very easy to make extremely it's very very easy to make very very refined sub plus with these very very refined sub plus with these very very refined sub plus with these kind of fascist functions and that's all kind of fascist functions and that's all kind of fascist functions and that's all I have I think I'm having to say about I have I think I'm having to say about I have I think I'm having to say about fascist for the time being you can do fascist for the time being you can do fascist for the time being you can do more more advanced stuff with them but more more advanced stuff with them but more more advanced stuff with them but basically this is the interface that you basically this is the interface that you basically this is the interface that you need facet wrap or fascist great need facet wrap or fascist great need facet wrap or fascist great depending on whether you want to make to depending on whether you want to make to depending on whether you want to make to look at just a single variable or two look at just a single variable or two look at just a single variable or two variables and then how they have the variables and then how they have the variables and then how they have the interact and let's just see what my interact and let's just see what my interact and let's just see what my exercise will be so not a lot of exercise will be so not a lot of exercise will be so not a lot of exercise anyway we have this plot a exercise anyway we have this plot a exercise anyway we have this plot a fastest of plot one of the great things fastest of plot one of the great things fastest of plot one of the great things about fascist is that they share the about fascist is that they share the about fascist is that they share the axis between the different panels this axis between the different panels this axis between the different panels this is a good thing in general which the is a good thing in general which the is a good thing in general which the reason why it's a good thing is that we reason why it's a good thing is that we reason why it's a good thing is that we can be sure that the the look whether we can be sure that the the look whether we can be sure that the the look whether we have in one panel can be just completely have in one panel can be just completely have in one panel can be just completely overlaid to the next panel because overlaid to the next panel because overlaid to the next panel because have the same positional access and so have the same positional access and so have the same positional access and so on so usually you want that but on so usually you want that but on so usually you want that but sometimes you don't and you can you can sometimes you don't and you can you can sometimes you don't and you can you can change this behavior with a scale change this behavior with a scale change this behavior with a scale document so let's just try and do that document so let's just try and do that document so let's just try and do that so here we have C scales now this can so here we have C scales now this can so here we have C scales now this can take three different values we can say take three different values we can say take three different values we can say scales equals free and this means that scales equals free and this means that scales equals free and this means that each panel will have completely free each panel will have completely free each panel will have completely free free exit scales and what we can see free exit scales and what we can see free exit scales and what we can see here is that they now they have their here is that they now they have their here is that they now they have their own y-axis each of them have their own own y-axis each of them have their own own y-axis each of them have their own y-axis and the x-axis is no longer the y-axis and the x-axis is no longer the y-axis and the x-axis is no longer the same down here right now you may think same down here right now you may think same down here right now you may think that this is nicer because all the that this is nicer because all the that this is nicer because all the points fill out the entire area they are points fill out the entire area they are points fill out the entire area they are much more you're zoomed into each area much more you're zoomed into each area much more you're zoomed into each area but when you just look at it you have no but when you just look at it you have no but when you just look at it you have no sense in in terms of how you can compare sense in in terms of how you can compare sense in in terms of how you can compare the two or three different different the two or three different different the two or three different different panels so this is this is less effective panels so this is this is less effective panels so this is this is less effective in terms of communicating the underlying in terms of communicating the underlying in terms of communicating the underlying data now as I said sometimes you may data now as I said sometimes you may data now as I said sometimes you may want it sometimes you may not you can want it sometimes you may not you can want it sometimes you may not you can also just free one of the scales instead also just free one of the scales instead also just free one of the scales instead so we can say free Y and we can see that so we can say free Y and we can see that so we can say free Y and we can see that now the x-axis is actually fixed but we now the x-axis is actually fixed but we now the x-axis is actually fixed but we have different y-axis for each of the have different y-axis for each of the have different y-axis for each of the panels and likewise with free x we can panels and likewise with free x we can panels and likewise with free x we can see that's now the y-axis is yet between see that's now the y-axis is yet between see that's now the y-axis is yet between all of them and the x-axis differs all of them and the x-axis differs all of them and the x-axis differs between the different panels yes between the different panels yes between the different panels yes so the next one usually the space so the next one usually the space so the next one usually the space occupied by each panel is equal as we occupied by each panel is equal as we occupied by each panel is equal as we can see up here they all of them are can see up here they all of them are can see up here they all of them are equally wide this can create problems equally wide this can create problems equally wide this can create problems with different screens are used so let's with different screens are used so let's with different screens are used so let's see here here we have like this is a horrible here we have like this is a horrible here we have like this is a horrible plug right and the reason why is a plug right and the reason why is a plug right and the reason why is a horrible plot is that they actually the horrible plot is that they actually the horrible plot is that they actually the reason why it's horrible is that they reason why it's horrible is that they reason why it's horrible is that they share the same the same scale because share the same the same scale because share the same the same scale because 2-seater for instance they only have 2-seater for instance they only have 2-seater for instance they only have representatives from one manufacturer representatives from one manufacturer representatives from one manufacturer and compact has representatives for some and compact has representatives for some and compact has representatives for some other and so on so a lot of space is other and so on so a lot of space is other and so on so a lot of space is being wasted showing no data and this is being wasted showing no data and this is being wasted showing no data and this is an an amazing possibility for using this an an amazing possibility for using this an an amazing possibility for using this space argument where we can space a space argument where we can space a space argument where we can space a space equals three why I think that will space equals three why I think that will space equals three why I think that will do it no that will not do it and the do it no that will not do it and the do it no that will not do it and the reason why I will not do it is that we reason why I will not do it is that we reason why I will not do it is that we still have fixed scales so just let me so now we're getting into the late live so now we're getting into the late live so now we're getting into the late live coding pad okay coding pad okay coding pad okay this worked so what we can see here now this worked so what we can see here now this worked so what we can see here now is that when we have free free scales to is that when we have free free scales to is that when we have free free scales to kind of combat this this loss of combat kind of combat this this loss of combat kind of combat this this loss of combat this amount of white space that we saw this amount of white space that we saw this amount of white space that we saw if we don't have free spaces as well if we don't have free spaces as well if we don't have free spaces as well what we see is that each panel will what we see is that each panel will what we see is that each panel will still take up the same height in the still take up the same height in the still take up the same height in the data so so the the 2-seater has the same data so so the the 2-seater has the same data so so the the 2-seater has the same height as the compact even though it height as the compact even though it height as the compact even though it only represents one observation and it only represents one observation and it only represents one observation and it kind of looks weird right so what we can kind of looks weird right so what we can kind of looks weird right so what we can do is with the space spaces argument do is with the space spaces argument do is with the space spaces argument space argument we can also make the space argument we can also make the space argument we can also make the space free and this will mean that the space free and this will mean that the space free and this will mean that the space is relative to the amount of data space is relative to the amount of data space is relative to the amount of data the range of the data that it represents the range of the data that it represents the range of the data that it represents right so now we ensure that all of the right so now we ensure that all of the right so now we ensure that all of the paths are equal and we don't have any paths are equal and we don't have any paths are equal and we don't have any any empty space that takes up our plot any empty space that takes up our plot any empty space that takes up our plot and it's much more readable now and it's much more readable now and it's much more readable now okay see I'm almost out of water let's okay see I'm almost out of water let's okay see I'm almost out of water let's see so last thing is fascists can be see so last thing is fascists can be see so last thing is fascists can be based on multiple variables by adding based on multiple variables by adding based on multiple variables by adding them together we didn't talk about that them together we didn't talk about that them together we didn't talk about that in the slides but we'll just briefly in the slides but we'll just briefly in the slides but we'll just briefly whistle here and when adding them whistle here and when adding them whistle here and when adding them together they kind of takes again the together they kind of takes again the together they kind of takes again the intersection between the different intersection between the different intersection between the different variables so when we have a passive grid variables so when we have a passive grid variables so when we have a passive grid here where we say here and drive will be here where we say here and drive will be here where we say here and drive will be the defining variables for the faceting the defining variables for the faceting the defining variables for the faceting another way to show this a less another way to show this a less another way to show this a less effective way but another way to show effective way but another way to show effective way but another way to show this is to use facet wrap and then this is to use facet wrap and then this is to use facet wrap and then instead saying drive here now how will instead saying drive here now how will instead saying drive here now how will that look now we can see in another way that look now we can see in another way that look now we can see in another way that that four-wheel drive in 99 1999 that that four-wheel drive in 99 1999 that that four-wheel drive in 99 1999 will have this panel and 4-wheel Drive will have this panel and 4-wheel Drive will have this panel and 4-wheel Drive and 2008 will have this panel so it's and 2008 will have this panel so it's and 2008 will have this panel so it's the same panels but they arranged in a the same panels but they arranged in a the same panels but they arranged in a different ways so we lose the idea of different ways so we lose the idea of different ways so we lose the idea of having rows that have the same the same having rows that have the same the same having rows that have the same the same variables and columns that has the same variables and columns that has the same variables and columns that has the same variables so I will argue that this is variables so I will argue that this is variables so I will argue that this is this is a less effective way of showing this is a less effective way of showing this is a less effective way of showing it but just to show that well we can it but just to show that well we can it but just to show that well we can actually do this we can add variables actually do this we can add variables actually do this we can add variables together to get even more fine-grained together to get even more fine-grained together to get even more fine-grained subsets of the data so we don't have subsets of the data so we don't have subsets of the data so we don't have we're not confined to only using one we're not confined to only using one we're not confined to only using one variable in our data okay of course variable in our data okay of course variable in our data okay of course combinatorially the amount of panels combinatorially the amount of panels combinatorially the amount of panels will explode if you begin to add like a will explode if you begin to add like a will explode if you begin to add like a lot of columns and a lot of combinations lot of columns and a lot of combinations lot of columns and a lot of combinations together that's just how it is okay back together that's just how it is okay back together that's just how it is okay back to quarters yeah so almost there I am I'm happy for yeah so almost there I am I'm happy for yeah so almost there I am I'm happy for the people that has as hold out till the the people that has as hold out till the the people that has as hold out till the end I know the it's it's late sometimes end I know the it's it's late sometimes end I know the it's it's late sometimes so very early sometimes and we talked so very early sometimes and we talked so very early sometimes and we talked about coordinates it's kind of the about coordinates it's kind of the about coordinates it's kind of the fabric that we're drawing onto what kind fabric that we're drawing onto what kind fabric that we're drawing onto what kind of of kennels of of kennels of of kennels should we draw it and when you think should we draw it and when you think should we draw it and when you think about it when we think about that we we about it when we think about that we we about it when we think about that we we are thinking about how should x and y be are thinking about how should x and y be are thinking about how should x and y be interpreted so the coordinate system interpreted so the coordinate system interpreted so the coordinate system does not mean anything for color for for does not mean anything for color for for does not mean anything for color for for shave and whatnot but it but it takes it shave and whatnot but it but it takes it shave and whatnot but it but it takes it goes in and it modifies x and y and one goes in and it modifies x and y and one goes in and it modifies x and y and one thing that is particularly relevant is thing that is particularly relevant is thing that is particularly relevant is that both limits and transformations can that both limits and transformations can that both limits and transformations can be applied both in scales and in be applied both in scales and in be applied both in scales and in coordinate systems now that seems weird coordinate systems now that seems weird coordinate systems now that seems weird and there's there are several subtle and there's there are several subtle and there's there are several subtle differences in where you can apply these differences in where you can apply these differences in where you can apply these and and these subtle differences are and and these subtle differences are and and these subtle differences are often lost and and this results in in a often lost and and this results in in a often lost and and this results in in a lot of head-scratching and a lot of lot of head-scratching and a lot of lot of head-scratching and a lot of people that gets weirded out by the people that gets weirded out by the people that gets weirded out by the behavior so it's a good thing to know behavior so it's a good thing to know behavior so it's a good thing to know about coordinate system because usually about coordinate system because usually about coordinate system because usually you want to do transformations and a you want to do transformations and a you want to do transformations and a limit setting in the coordinate system limit setting in the coordinate system limit setting in the coordinate system rather than the scale if you can so rather than the scale if you can so rather than the scale if you can so basically the difference is that scales basically the difference is that scales basically the difference is that scales will be applies in the beginning so so will be applies in the beginning so so will be applies in the beginning so so scales will take your input data and it scales will take your input data and it scales will take your input data and it will scale it before before your your will scale it before before your your will scale it before before your your team gets it and that means that that if team gets it and that means that that if team gets it and that means that that if you're if you set the limits and you you're if you set the limits and you you're if you set the limits and you have data outside of the limits that have data outside of the limits that have data outside of the limits that data will simply just vanish it will data will simply just vanish it will data will simply just vanish it will disappear whereas if you set limits in disappear whereas if you set limits in disappear whereas if you set limits in the coordinate system that that data is the coordinate system that that data is the coordinate system that that data is still there because the limit has not still there because the limit has not still there because the limit has not been enforced yet and it will only be been enforced yet and it will only be been enforced yet and it will only be be changed at the very very end of be changed at the very very end of be changed at the very very end of everything everything everything so coordinate systems basically doesn't so coordinate systems basically doesn't so coordinate systems basically doesn't change anything about which data is change anything about which data is change anything about which data is there and how the data looks kinda but there and how the data looks kinda but there and how the data looks kinda but it does change how it's getting drawn so it does change how it's getting drawn so it does change how it's getting drawn so we'll look into that furthermore we'll look into that furthermore we'll look into that furthermore coordinate systems extremely useful in coordinate systems extremely useful in coordinate systems extremely useful in Katoch rafi and as we talked about with Katoch rafi and as we talked about with Katoch rafi and as we talked about with map projections and so on there is not a map projections and so on there is not a map projections and so on there is not a single best way of drawing the whole single best way of drawing the whole single best way of drawing the whole earth into 2d there's it's all about earth into 2d there's it's all about earth into 2d there's it's all about concessions and figuring out what's concessions and figuring out what's concessions and figuring out what's important for this particular plot so important for this particular plot so important for this particular plot so there's a lot of different ways of there's a lot of different ways of there's a lot of different ways of transforming longitudes and latitudes transforming longitudes and latitudes transforming longitudes and latitudes into x and y representations on the into x and y representations on the into x and y representations on the canvas now we have only looked at a canvas now we have only looked at a canvas now we have only looked at a Cartesian coordinate system now for now Cartesian coordinate system now for now Cartesian coordinate system now for now which is like this idea that X defines which is like this idea that X defines which is like this idea that X defines the horizontal position and Y defines the horizontal position and Y defines the horizontal position and Y defines the the vertical position and there are the the vertical position and there are the the vertical position and there are other coordinate system built into into other coordinate system built into into other coordinate system built into into ggplot2 one of them is called polar ggplot2 one of them is called polar ggplot2 one of them is called polar which is a polar coordinate system and a which is a polar coordinate system and a which is a polar coordinate system and a polar coordinate system interprets x and polar coordinate system interprets x and polar coordinate system interprets x and y in a different way it interprets x and y in a different way it interprets x and y in a different way it interprets x and y as radius and angle and and this y as radius and angle and and this y as radius and angle and and this results in a very very different plot so results in a very very different plot so results in a very very different plot so so this GM bar plot that was would so this GM bar plot that was would so this GM bar plot that was would usually just be a bar plot it's usually just be a bar plot it's usually just be a bar plot it's certainly what we will call a wind rose certainly what we will call a wind rose certainly what we will call a wind rose and when you change whether x and y and when you change whether x and y and when you change whether x and y whether X is mapped to radius or exam whether X is mapped to radius or exam whether X is mapped to radius or exam it's mapped to angle or when you change it's mapped to angle or when you change it's mapped to angle or when you change that around we get a very very different that around we get a very very different that around we get a very very different plot so now we can get this kind of a plot so now we can get this kind of a plot so now we can get this kind of a circular race chart if you have an Apple circular race chart if you have an Apple circular race chart if you have an Apple watch I guess it's kind of reminiscent watch I guess it's kind of reminiscent watch I guess it's kind of reminiscent about the activity view there about the activity view there about the activity view there so this is none of these plots are so this is none of these plots are so this is none of these plots are particularly informative but this is particularly informative but this is particularly informative but this is just to show that the coordinate system just to show that the coordinate system just to show that the coordinate system has a huge say in terms of the final has a huge say in terms of the final has a huge say in terms of the final look of the plot because it it takes it look of the plot because it it takes it look of the plot because it it takes it takes all the data that's getting takes all the data that's getting takes all the data that's getting through all the pipeline and then it through all the pipeline and then it through all the pipeline and then it just says well I know that you have an just says well I know that you have an just says well I know that you have an idea about what to do with this data but idea about what to do with this data but idea about what to do with this data but I define the universe that you can plot I define the universe that you can plot I define the universe that you can plot it in i define what x and y are i define it in i define what x and y are i define it in i define what x and y are i define how they relate to each other and I how they relate to each other and I how they relate to each other and I define how everything should be drawn so define how everything should be drawn so define how everything should be drawn so coordinate system has a huge say in how coordinate system has a huge say in how coordinate system has a huge say in how the final look of your plus it's going the final look of your plus it's going the final look of your plus it's going to to be now most plus at plus are drawn to to be now most plus at plus are drawn to to be now most plus at plus are drawn in a Cartesian coordinate system so in a Cartesian coordinate system so in a Cartesian coordinate system so usually you don't have these kind of usually you don't have these kind of usually you don't have these kind of weird complete transformations of your weird complete transformations of your weird complete transformations of your plot as we see with polar but even so plot as we see with polar but even so plot as we see with polar but even so even if you're only using Cartesian and even if you're only using Cartesian and even if you're only using Cartesian and coordinate systems it's a very good idea coordinate systems it's a very good idea coordinate systems it's a very good idea to know about the course and the reason to know about the course and the reason to know about the course and the reason for that is particularly relevant when for that is particularly relevant when for that is particularly relevant when you're trying to do some zooming in you're trying to do some zooming in you're trying to do some zooming in usually when people try to zoom in on usually when people try to zoom in on usually when people try to zoom in on their data they will set limits to the their data they will set limits to the their data they will set limits to the scale and as we talked about that's one scale and as we talked about that's one scale and as we talked about that's one approach here we're saying well we have approach here we're saying well we have approach here we're saying well we have this GM bar bar plot that we have seen a this GM bar bar plot that we have seen a this GM bar bar plot that we have seen a lot of times and now I want to zoom in lot of times and now I want to zoom in lot of times and now I want to zoom in so that the the plot is between 0 and 40 so that the the plot is between 0 and 40 so that the the plot is between 0 and 40 on the y axis now this looks weird and on the y axis now this looks weird and on the y axis now this looks weird and we get this warning as well remove three we get this warning as well remove three we get this warning as well remove three rows containing missing values now why rows containing missing values now why rows containing missing values now why did that happen did that happen did that happen well it did happen because because when well it did happen because because when well it did happen because because when you have when you set a limit to your you have when you set a limit to your you have when you set a limit to your scale you define the limits of what the scale you define the limits of what the scale you define the limits of what the scale understands and if you have values scale understands and if you have values scale understands and if you have values outside of the limits in the scale they outside of the limits in the scale they outside of the limits in the scale they will get bigger than be removed because will get bigger than be removed because will get bigger than be removed because they have no meaning in the plot so they have no meaning in the plot so they have no meaning in the plot so it'll just be removed so so these limits it'll just be removed so so these limits it'll just be removed so so these limits have actually removed have actually removed have actually removed the bass for compact and midsize and SUV the bass for compact and midsize and SUV the bass for compact and midsize and SUV because they were higher than 40 and because they were higher than 40 and because they were higher than 40 and usually when you assume you don't want usually when you assume you don't want usually when you assume you don't want to have that right you want to you want to have that right you want to you want to have that right you want to you want to keep like the representation of your to keep like the representation of your to keep like the representation of your plot you just want to zoom in and you plot you just want to zoom in and you plot you just want to zoom in and you can achieve that by zooming within the can achieve that by zooming within the can achieve that by zooming within the coordinate system because here you're coordinate system because here you're coordinate system because here you're just kind of stretching the fabric just kind of stretching the fabric just kind of stretching the fabric you're not removing anything you're just you're not removing anything you're just you're not removing anything you're just changing the area that you're looking at changing the area that you're looking at changing the area that you're looking at so if we do exactly the same with with so if we do exactly the same with with so if we do exactly the same with with cut Cartesian and then set the wild cut Cartesian and then set the wild cut Cartesian and then set the wild limits to zero to 40 then we get the limits to zero to 40 then we get the limits to zero to 40 then we get the look that we're looking for right and look that we're looking for right and look that we're looking for right and that along with not puddings aesthetic that along with not puddings aesthetic that along with not puddings aesthetic settings inside es but outside is settings inside es but outside is settings inside es but outside is probably my second main takeaway because probably my second main takeaway because probably my second main takeaway because that's the other big big surprise for a that's the other big big surprise for a that's the other big big surprise for a lot of people it's not only by lot of people it's not only by lot of people it's not only by surprising in that it removes stuffs but surprising in that it removes stuffs but surprising in that it removes stuffs but but for certain things such as polygons but for certain things such as polygons but for certain things such as polygons and so on it will remove some of the and so on it will remove some of the and so on it will remove some of the points and the shape will be completely points and the shape will be completely points and the shape will be completely distorted and people don't realize that distorted and people don't realize that distorted and people don't realize that it's because this if zoom limits within it's because this if zoom limits within it's because this if zoom limits within the scale instead of within the corner the scale instead of within the corner the scale instead of within the corner of the coordinate system so if if your of the coordinate system so if if your of the coordinate system so if if your purpose is to zoom then always do it in purpose is to zoom then always do it in purpose is to zoom then always do it in the coordinate system if you just the coordinate system if you just the coordinate system if you just remember that everything will be fine remember that everything will be fine remember that everything will be fine it'll be okay we can do this so I am it'll be okay we can do this so I am it'll be okay we can do this so I am pretty sure I have a few exercises for pretty sure I have a few exercises for pretty sure I have a few exercises for coordinate systems before the last last coordinate systems before the last last coordinate systems before the last last part okay so we have this plot there we part okay so we have this plot there we part okay so we have this plot there we go and in the same way as limits can be go and in the same way as limits can be go and in the same way as limits can be said in both the scales and the said in both the scales and the said in both the scales and the coordinate system transformation coordinate system transformation coordinate system transformation canceling can as well we can do that canceling can as well we can do that canceling can as well we can do that using the core trance coordinate system using the core trance coordinate system using the core trance coordinate system which is a Cartesian coordinate system which is a Cartesian coordinate system which is a Cartesian coordinate system where you can just add transformations where you can just add transformations where you can just add transformations to two X or Y so modify the code below to two X or Y so modify the code below to two X or Y so modify the code below to apply a large transformation to the Y to apply a large transformation to the Y to apply a large transformation to the Y axis axis axis first you scale why continues and then first you scale why continues and then first you scale why continues and then use cold trends so let's see what use cold trends so let's see what use cold trends so let's see what happens here actually so scale why happens here actually so scale why happens here actually so scale why continues what do we have you now that's continues what do we have you now that's continues what do we have you now that's not a beautiful plot right and the main not a beautiful plot right and the main not a beautiful plot right and the main reason why it's not beautiful is that reason why it's not beautiful is that reason why it's not beautiful is that the breaks in the y axis are horrible the breaks in the y axis are horrible the breaks in the y axis are horrible now why are they horrible this is now why are they horrible this is now why are they horrible this is because that the scale will transform because that the scale will transform because that the scale will transform the input values prior to doing any the input values prior to doing any the input values prior to doing any brake calculations so it will take the brake calculations so it will take the brake calculations so it will take the input values it will it will transform input values it will it will transform input values it will it will transform them and then just from there on now them and then just from there on now them and then just from there on now these are the new values and this also these are the new values and this also these are the new values and this also means that when when trying to figuring means that when when trying to figuring means that when when trying to figuring out when trying to figure out the out when trying to figure out the out when trying to figure out the correct break points it completely correct break points it completely correct break points it completely messes things up now if we instead do messes things up now if we instead do messes things up now if we instead do for trans and can't remember the for trans and can't remember the for trans and can't remember the arguments it's just yes arguments it's just yes arguments it's just yes y equals slack hopefully we'll get y equals slack hopefully we'll get y equals slack hopefully we'll get something that's slightly more beautiful something that's slightly more beautiful something that's slightly more beautiful right so this is this is the look that right so this is this is the look that right so this is this is the look that we want and the reason why it's it's we want and the reason why it's it's we want and the reason why it's it's better is that the breaks and break better is that the breaks and break better is that the breaks and break points has been calculated on normal points has been calculated on normal points has been calculated on normal data we are just kind of stretching the data we are just kind of stretching the data we are just kind of stretching the fabric so that it matches a lock fabric so that it matches a lock fabric so that it matches a lock transformation and again this idea of transformation and again this idea of transformation and again this idea of just having a fabric that you can kind just having a fabric that you can kind just having a fabric that you can kind of stretch and do transformations with of stretch and do transformations with of stretch and do transformations with after the plot has actually been placed after the plot has actually been placed after the plot has actually been placed upon the fabric is it's a very good upon the fabric is it's a very good upon the fabric is it's a very good metaphor for what the cut the coordinate metaphor for what the cut the coordinate metaphor for what the cut the coordinate system is actually doing and it also system is actually doing and it also system is actually doing and it also makes it quite easy to reason about why makes it quite easy to reason about why makes it quite easy to reason about why it's behaving in a more sensible way it's behaving in a more sensible way it's behaving in a more sensible way usually than doing things in the scale usually than doing things in the scale usually than doing things in the scale instead and yes so and we talked about instead and yes so and we talked about instead and yes so and we talked about and we're not getting into that much and we're not getting into that much and we're not getting into that much spatial data and cartography because spatial data and cartography because spatial data and cartography because that is also a huge area and I'm not the that is also a huge area and I'm not the that is also a huge area and I'm not the best person to educate and done you best person to educate and done you best person to educate and done you educate your honors but coordinate educate your honors but coordinate educate your honors but coordinate systems are very very important for it systems are very very important for it systems are very very important for it and ggplot2 has a great support for and ggplot2 has a great support for and ggplot2 has a great support for plotting maps especially with the newish plotting maps especially with the newish plotting maps especially with the newish GMS F and then quarters F and let's see GMS F and then quarters F and let's see GMS F and then quarters F and let's see and which interface with the fantastic and which interface with the fantastic and which interface with the fantastic sf package so if you're doing spatial sf package so if you're doing spatial sf package so if you're doing spatial stuff you should use the SF package and stuff you should use the SF package and stuff you should use the SF package and you can plot with with G to plot to you can plot with with G to plot to you can plot with with G to plot to using G MSF so the reason why it's so at using G MSF so the reason why it's so at using G MSF so the reason why it's so at coordinate systems are so important as coordinate systems are so important as coordinate systems are so important as we've talked about it's very very we've talked about it's very very we've talked about it's very very difficult to to map globally a data into difficult to to map globally a data into difficult to to map globally a data into a 2d representation that is truthful so a 2d representation that is truthful so a 2d representation that is truthful so if we just we just create some we will if we just we just create some we will if we just we just create some we will not do that today I have no idea why my not do that today I have no idea why my not do that today I have no idea why my computer is freaking out about that anyway that is for you to try out maybe anyway that is for you to try out maybe anyway that is for you to try out maybe you don't get this this area but but the you don't get this this area but but the you don't get this this area but but the time is already too late for you to look time is already too late for you to look time is already too late for you to look at me trying to figure it out so we'll at me trying to figure it out so we'll at me trying to figure it out so we'll jump on to theme that's the joy of life jump on to theme that's the joy of life jump on to theme that's the joy of life coding I guess there we go coding I guess there we go coding I guess there we go so this is the last part of the first so this is the last part of the first so this is the last part of the first part of the of the webinar just slightly part of the of the webinar just slightly part of the of the webinar just slightly small discussion about theme and as we small discussion about theme and as we small discussion about theme and as we talked about themes are religious talked about themes are religious talked about themes are religious stylistic changes to the plot and they stylistic changes to the plot and they stylistic changes to the plot and they are not related to data in any way so are not related to data in any way so are not related to data in any way so that's just whatever you want in terms that's just whatever you want in terms that's just whatever you want in terms of aesthetic style and and indeed you of aesthetic style and and indeed you of aesthetic style and and indeed you plot - geez / - has a fantastic theming plot - geez / - has a fantastic theming plot - geez / - has a fantastic theming system and it's both possible for you to system and it's both possible for you to system and it's both possible for you to to modify theming with a completely to modify theming with a completely to modify theming with a completely pre-packed theme but you can also both pre-packed theme but you can also both pre-packed theme but you can also both add a pre-pack theme and then do small add a pre-pack theme and then do small add a pre-pack theme and then do small per element modification to it per element modification to it per element modification to it afterwards and one thing to take away afterwards and one thing to take away afterwards and one thing to take away especially is the theming is radical it especially is the theming is radical it especially is the theming is radical it is not as if you are a web developer of is not as if you are a web developer of is not as if you are a web developer of tribe web development it is not the same tribe web development it is not the same tribe web development it is not the same as CSS but it kind of captures some of as CSS but it kind of captures some of as CSS but it kind of captures some of the same ideas that the things are here the same ideas that the things are here the same ideas that the things are here at Google and let's just have a look at at Google and let's just have a look at at Google and let's just have a look at it so we have all all the other pluses it so we have all all the other pluses it so we have all all the other pluses we've seen before has Eustace this we've seen before has Eustace this we've seen before has Eustace this beautiful gray background that everyone beautiful gray background that everyone beautiful gray background that everyone loves about ggplot2 but if you want to loves about ggplot2 but if you want to loves about ggplot2 but if you want to be a rebel and not use the gray be a rebel and not use the gray be a rebel and not use the gray background you can do that by adding background you can do that by adding background you can do that by adding another theme to it and here we're just another theme to it and here we're just another theme to it and here we're just adding the minimal to this plot and we adding the minimal to this plot and we adding the minimal to this plot and we can see that the gray background is gone can see that the gray background is gone can see that the gray background is gone in in favor of a very very minimal style in in favor of a very very minimal style in in favor of a very very minimal style which is actually one of the styles that which is actually one of the styles that which is actually one of the styles that I I usually prefer so it's very very I I usually prefer so it's very very I I usually prefer so it's very very quick to change the overall look using quick to change the overall look using quick to change the overall look using building themes and also and again we building themes and also and again we building themes and also and again we will talk about this later will talk about this later will talk about this later or we'll talk about this in the next or we'll talk about this in the next or we'll talk about this in the next webinar there's a lot of extensions that webinar there's a lot of extensions that webinar there's a lot of extensions that come with with built in themes so you're come with with built in themes so you're come with with built in themes so you're not confined to only using these these not confined to only using these these not confined to only using these these predefined themes you can also go crazy predefined themes you can also go crazy predefined themes you can also go crazy and say well here we have minimal and and say well here we have minimal and and say well here we have minimal and then I'm also doing all different things then I'm also doing all different things then I'm also doing all different things and I'm targeting specific parts of the and I'm targeting specific parts of the and I'm targeting specific parts of the plot area to really create and make it plot area to really create and make it plot area to really create and make it the exact way I want to so just to go the exact way I want to so just to go the exact way I want to so just to go through this is absolutely the longest through this is absolutely the longest through this is absolutely the longest ggplot2 code we have we have seen yet ggplot2 code we have we have seen yet ggplot2 code we have we have seen yet it's a we start with ggplot it's using it's a we start with ggplot it's using it's a we start with ggplot it's using the MGP days as we know and using GM the MGP days as we know and using GM the MGP days as we know and using GM power and juicing faces wraps then we're power and juicing faces wraps then we're power and juicing faces wraps then we're using the the laps function to set title using the the laps function to set title using the the laps function to set title and it's also setting a caption which is small text that's below the which is small text that's below the which is small text that's below the plot and then we are sitting x and y plot and then we are sitting x and y plot and then we are sitting x and y tiles to know which kind of removes the tiles to know which kind of removes the tiles to know which kind of removes the removes the the titles from the x and y removes the the titles from the x and y removes the the titles from the x and y axis and sometimes that's actually a axis and sometimes that's actually a axis and sometimes that's actually a good idea because we don't really like good idea because we don't really like good idea because we don't really like the the y axis is pretty the the y axis is pretty the the y axis is pretty self-explanatory like SUV subcompact self-explanatory like SUV subcompact self-explanatory like SUV subcompact pickup and so on we don't we we don't pickup and so on we don't we we don't pickup and so on we don't we we don't need to know that that's a class of car need to know that that's a class of car need to know that that's a class of car furthermore the title number of cars car furthermore the title number of cars car furthermore the title number of cars car models per class actually tells us models per class actually tells us models per class actually tells us what's x and y are anyway so we can just what's x and y are anyway so we can just what's x and y are anyway so we can just remove it and remove redundancies then remove it and remove redundancies then remove it and remove redundancies then we change the expansion of the scale we change the expansion of the scale we change the expansion of the scale axis that's not as important then we add axis that's not as important then we add axis that's not as important then we add theme minimal and then comes like this theme minimal and then comes like this theme minimal and then comes like this huge theme chunk where we do like huge theme chunk where we do like huge theme chunk where we do like additional modifications to the theme additional modifications to the theme additional modifications to the theme and we say well for the text I don't and we say well for the text I don't and we say well for the text I don't want to use the the default text I want want to use the the default text I want want to use the the default text I want to be like highbrow and fancy and use a to be like highbrow and fancy and use a to be like highbrow and fancy and use a veneer next condensed which is a super veneer next condensed which is a super veneer next condensed which is a super fancy font and we we define this using fancy font and we we define this using fancy font and we we define this using element text function now the reason why element text function now the reason why element text function now the reason why we don't just say text equals Avenue we don't just say text equals Avenue we don't just say text equals Avenue next condensed is that well there's a next condensed is that well there's a next condensed is that well there's a lot of settings to text right there's lot of settings to text right there's lot of settings to text right there's both the the family that we're setting both the the family that we're setting both the the family that we're setting here but also the size there's also here but also the size there's also here but also the size there's also whether it should be italic or bold or whether it should be italic or bold or whether it should be italic or bold or whatever and all these settings is kind whatever and all these settings is kind whatever and all these settings is kind of confined inside this element text of confined inside this element text of confined inside this element text function and we use the hierarchical function and we use the hierarchical function and we use the hierarchical nature of the theming by setting nature of the theming by setting nature of the theming by setting stripped up text is again equal to stripped up text is again equal to stripped up text is again equal to element text its element text its element text its inheriting the Avenir next condensed inheriting the Avenir next condensed inheriting the Avenir next condensed because strip text is a it's a child of because strip text is a it's a child of because strip text is a it's a child of the text the text element and now is the text the text element and now is the text the text element and now is just safe say that it should be bold and just safe say that it should be bold and just safe say that it should be bold and we don't want to be centered we should we don't want to be centered we should we don't want to be centered we should just have it left justified and we do just have it left justified and we do just have it left justified and we do the same with with the plot caption is the same with with the plot caption is the same with with the plot caption is again element text would just say it again element text would just say it again element text would just say it should be at a lake instead but it's should be at a lake instead but it's should be at a lake instead but it's still evan your next condensed because still evan your next condensed because still evan your next condensed because that's inherited from text just to show that's inherited from text just to show that's inherited from text just to show that we can also change other things that we can also change other things that we can also change other things than just the funds and the text than just the funds and the text than just the funds and the text so the panel grid we changed that to be so the panel grid we changed that to be so the panel grid we changed that to be white using the element line and we white using the element line and we white using the element line and we changed the size of it changed the size of it changed the size of it and then we remove the minor and major y grid lines as well and we use that we do grid lines as well and we use that we do grid lines as well and we use that we do that using element blank an element plan that using element blank an element plan that using element blank an element plan can be added to any element just say can be added to any element just say can be added to any element just say don't don't draw this element at all don't don't draw this element at all don't don't draw this element at all just ignore it completely just ignore it completely just ignore it completely and then at least at last there is and then at least at last there is and then at least at last there is there's a few settings that that doesn't there's a few settings that that doesn't there's a few settings that that doesn't take some of these element underscore take some of these element underscore take some of these element underscore functions but just take a single scalar functions but just take a single scalar functions but just take a single scalar value so panel on top is a switch that value so panel on top is a switch that value so panel on top is a switch that says well the gridlines and so on says well the gridlines and so on says well the gridlines and so on draw them on top of the data and now we draw them on top of the data and now we draw them on top of the data and now we have this this very very different look have this this very very different look have this this very very different look and all of this just goes to show that and all of this just goes to show that and all of this just goes to show that you can do a lot of different things you can do a lot of different things you can do a lot of different things with the theming system and you can with the theming system and you can with the theming system and you can achieve almost exactly this specific achieve almost exactly this specific achieve almost exactly this specific look that you want with with ggplot2 look that you want with with ggplot2 look that you want with with ggplot2 you're not confined to this this default you're not confined to this this default you're not confined to this this default gray background that people usually recognized from ggplot2 and that's it recognized from ggplot2 and that's it recognized from ggplot2 and that's it because next time and I still don't have because next time and I still don't have because next time and I still don't have a date for that hopefully next week we a date for that hopefully next week we a date for that hopefully next week we will begin to talk about the extension will begin to talk about the extension will begin to talk about the extension system so hopefully you've gotten a system so hopefully you've gotten a system so hopefully you've gotten a grasp about the ggplot2 API and not just grasp about the ggplot2 API and not just grasp about the ggplot2 API and not just the idea that there are a lot of the idea that there are a lot of the idea that there are a lot of different functions but hopefully you different functions but hopefully you different functions but hopefully you have gotten some idea about the logic have gotten some idea about the logic have gotten some idea about the logic behind it that there is a reason why behind it that there is a reason why behind it that there is a reason why there are GM's and scales and so on and there are GM's and scales and so on and there are GM's and scales and so on and hopefully and I really really hope that hopefully and I really really hope that hopefully and I really really hope that this is this has come across this this this is this has come across this this this is this has come across this this theoretical underpinning to the API this theoretical underpinning to the API this theoretical underpinning to the API this grammar of graphics means that you don't grammar of graphics means that you don't grammar of graphics means that you don't have to know all the different gems for have to know all the different gems for have to know all the different gems for instance you don't need to know the instance you don't need to know the instance you don't need to know the complete API of tu plus 2 you just need complete API of tu plus 2 you just need complete API of tu plus 2 you just need to know that if I want to change how to know that if I want to change how to know that if I want to change how data looks like which how to draw the data looks like which how to draw the data looks like which how to draw the data I should look into GM's and if I data I should look into GM's and if I data I should look into GM's and if I want to change something in terms of want to change something in terms of want to change something in terms of which colors are used to sounds so which colors are used to sounds so which colors are used to sounds so like that I should use into scale so like that I should use into scale so like that I should use into scale so hopefully hopefully this has come across hopefully hopefully this has come across hopefully hopefully this has come across because this this theoretical because this this theoretical because this this theoretical undercurrent that lies in the API means undercurrent that lies in the API means undercurrent that lies in the API means that there's the sense to to all the that there's the sense to to all the that there's the sense to to all the decisions that we make and once you get decisions that we make and once you get decisions that we make and once you get accustomed to that that logic it becomes accustomed to that that logic it becomes accustomed to that that logic it becomes much more easy to navigate inside much more easy to navigate inside much more easy to navigate inside ggplot2 and and hopefully this the ggplot2 and and hopefully this the ggplot2 and and hopefully this the theoretical start has actually made made theoretical start has actually made made theoretical start has actually made made you grasp that sense a bit more you see you grasp that sense a bit more you see you grasp that sense a bit more you see that's at least my hope for it so that's that's at least my hope for it so that's that's at least my hope for it so that's it for today I I thank the people that it for today I I thank the people that it for today I I thank the people that have stuck with me throughout throughout have stuck with me throughout throughout have stuck with me throughout throughout this presentation and I hope to see you this presentation and I hope to see you this presentation and I hope to see you again potentially next week but look out again potentially next week but look out again potentially next week but look out for my well for this YouTube channel I for my well for this YouTube channel I for my well for this YouTube channel I will I will advertise the the next part will I will advertise the the next part will I will advertise the the next part of the webinar here and I will also of the webinar here and I will also of the webinar here and I will also advertise it on Twitter so thank you for advertise it on Twitter so thank you for advertise it on Twitter so thank you for today and Oh last thing I have not been today and Oh last thing I have not been today and Oh last thing I have not been able to take any questions during my able to take any questions during my able to take any questions during my rambling here so I will try to to go rambling here so I will try to to go rambling here so I will try to to go through all of the the things in the through all of the the things in the through all of the the things in the chat and if there are some some very chat and if there are some some very chat and if there are some some very very good questions I'll try to answer very good questions I'll try to answer very good questions I'll try to answer them in the beginning of the next the them in the beginning of the next the them in the beginning of the next the next part I think that makes more sense next part I think that makes more sense next part I think that makes more sense than than stepping up every time so than than stepping up every time so than than stepping up every time so thank you all and enjoy the rest of thank you all and enjoy the rest of thank you all and enjoy the rest of potential time I hope to see you again potential time I hope to see you again potential time I hope to see you again
